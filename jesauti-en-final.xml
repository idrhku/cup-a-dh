<div1 id="id104010" type="sec"><head>Translator's Preface</head>
<div2 id="id104430" type="ss1"><head>Preface</head><p>Sometime before 1562 Giovanni Andrea from Brescia, Italy, a friar of the Order of Saint Jerome (usually known as the Jesuatti) in Lucca, Italy, began to write down the remedies that the friars used to cure the sick and to care for the human body. He organized his compilation according to the condition for which the remedy was used, whether the remedy was a galenical mixture of herbs, a distillate using the alchemical methods employed by the friars, or a prayer. A few remedies were incantations or amulets to protect against an illness or harm. Andrea did not explain the source of the remedies except in a few instances when he identified the author. The remainder may have been collected by the friars over the 200 year existence of the Order before Andrea began his task. The handwritten manuscript, now in the rare book collection of the Kenneth Spencer Research Library of the University of Kansas, was taken over on his death in 1562 by another friar who identified himself as Antonio from Spain. Friar Antonio added a few remedies and notes on the margins of the pages. Two other individuals signed their names in the book (Friar Angelo Biogi and Diego Henero from Caceras, Spain). Friar Angelo Biogi wrote in script and may have been responsible for a few remedies written in script in the last pages of the manuscript and the index to the remedies in script at the end of the manuscript. The remainder of the manuscript may be attributed to Andrea. Those few portions clearly written in a hand different from Andrea’s are identified in the translation by an asterisk at the beginning of the remedy. The book consists of 207 parchment folios, each approximately 20 x 26 cm. Each page contains about 43 lines of text. Most remedies are fitted on the page without carry-over to the next page, suggesting that Andrea edited as he wrote down the remedies. The remedies are written in Italian except for about ten percent which are in Latin, most of the latter are prayers.</p><p>The manuscript was deliberately damaged in three ways. Some remedies were obliterated by ink as if a brush filled with ink was used to cover the writing. A second type of damage was to mark over some lines with ink and also erase some words. Lesser damage was inflicted on some remedies, mostly prayers, by drawing diagonal lines across the remedy. This third kind of damage has not prevented transcription of the remedy. Remedies suffering the first two types of damage have not been transcribed. Most of the prayers and incantations also were marked by a wavy line drawn along the left-hand margin of the remedy without touching the writing. Three folios are missing from the manuscript. The folios were numbered in the upper right hand corner in two separate portions. The first 20 folios (listed in the transcription as Folios 1 to 20, pages 1 to 40) contain auxiliary information but no remedies. The remedies begin in the next part starting again with Folio 1 to Folio 166, pages 41 to 392. Because these latter folio numbers are used both in the index at the beginning and end of the manuscript, the folio numbers in the transcription follow this second set of folios. Page numbers continue sequentially from the beginning to the end of the manuscript.</p><p>The original manuscript was primarily written in a Renaissance version of the Italian language with about ten percent of the remedies written in Latin. Throughout the translation the original phraseology has been retained as much as is appropriate for clarity. Accent marks on vowels as used in modern Italian were never used except in a few cases, such as the final index in script probably by a different hand than Andrea’s. Other differences from modern Italian are common in the manuscript. There is variation in spelling of some words. Double consonants in modern Italian, such a ‘p’ or ‘t’ in some words are inconsistently doubled in the manuscript. Vowel shifts and phonetic variations are common. The same word may be spelled in more than one way in the same paragraph. No changes have been made in spelling in the transcription except where the change is placed in brackets.</p><p>In the translation some changes have been made in the tenses of verbs for clarity as to which person is being addressed. Most remedies were directed to the practitioner who was treating a patient, characteristically beginning with <hi rend="italic">‘Torai’</hi> (you will take) or <hi rend="italic">‘Rx.’</hi> (take) this ingredient to make the remedy. However, at the end of many remedies, Andrea added a direct address to the patient, ‘You should take care of yourself and watch what you eat,’ or similar advice. The remedies were intended for treatment of a wide range of conditions from serious illnesses, such as malaria or tuberculosis, to minor illnesses, such as headache, and to less serious complaints, such as gray hair and wrinkles. Although the book was a treatise for practitioners of medicine for humans, a few remedies at the end of the book were directed to the treatment of horses, certainly a valuable partner in the life of many persons at the time.</p><p>The remedies were of all kinds: waters, oils, electuaries, syrups, ointments, salves, plasters and pills. The most notable difference in the types of remedies, compared with modern drugs, is the small number of kinds of pills that were prepared and the large number of remedies applied to the skin.</p><p>Directions for preparation of poultices, plasters and salves were often a simple statement that the ingredients should be combined using the ‘usual method’ for making the product. In contrast to this limited advice, Andrea described the methods of distillation required to produce many of the remedies in great detail. In this part the book resembles the well-known book by Brunswig on the art of distilling medicaments. Detailed descriptions of the correct equipment, with drawings, are included. Alchemical equipment and methods for distillation of brandy are especially complete. The difficult distillation of sulfuric acid from copper sulfate is given in detail. For simple distillations of remedies, the water bath or bain marie was used extensively with attention to the different results obtained with immersing the bottom of a flask in water or heating with steam, ashes or directly with wood or charcoal fire. Although the emphasis on alchemical methods for production of remedies was sophistocated relative to many of the contemporaries of the friars, the concept of disease in the manuscript followed without question the traditional doctrines of Hippocrates and Galen.</p><p>In translating the names of plants to their scientific names, uncertainty is inevitable. Where the name is one commonly used by the apothocaries of the period, the translation may be accurate. The general problem of determining the precise names of plants in old herbals has been discussed by Stearn (p.64-65) in reference to the Herbarium Apulei.</p><p>Some plant names used in this manuscript have changed in meaning over the years. For example, ‘laudanum’ originally meant the sweet-smelling gum from the rock rose ( <hi rend="italic">Cistus</hi> ), a plant native to the Mediterranean region. Later Paracelsus appropriated ‘laudanum’ for his popular prescription containing opium. ‘Laudanum’ eventually came to mean ‘tincture of opium’ in the pharmacopoeias, as it does today. Another plant product that has changed meaning is ‘turpentine.’ Turpentine originally meant the resin obtained from <hi rend="italic">Pistacia lenticus</hi> and then was transferred to resins from conifers such as the larch in Europe. The resin could be soft as it was exuded from the tree or dry as the more volatile components of terpenes evaporated. Now ‘turpentine’ is used almost exclusively for the liquid fraction from <hi rend="italic">Pinus australis</hi> composed of terpenes, the distilled fraction that used to be called ‘oil of turpentine’ or ‘spirits of turpentine.’ The dried resin remaining after distillation is now called ‘rosin.’ In this translation ‘turpentine’ is used in the old meaning of the complete resin from <hi rend="italic">Pistacia lenticus</hi> unless otherwise identified.</p><p>There is marked inconsistency in the spelling of the names of some plants. For example, the various spellings of the word for parsley go from <hi rend="italic">petroselim</hi> (close to the Latin name in Pliny, VII, p.531) to <hi rend="italic">prezemolo</hi> (close to modern Italian) with about 16 spellings in between. In some remedies a plant name is followed by a second identification, such as ‘ <hi rend="italic">vitriola del muro, id est paritaria</hi> .’ These double names are included in the Glossary and have been used as the best guide to the intent of the writer of the remedy.</p><p>To some extent there is uncertainty in translation of the names of chemicals in the manuscript to English. Some specific concerns are noted in the Glossary. A detailed examination of the general problem of translation from 16th Century chemistry to modern terminology has been discussed by Crosland (p.94 et seq.).</p><p>Plants and plant products, animals and animal products and minerals in the remedies are defined in the Glossary. The Glossary should be considered a guide to the ingredients in the remedies, but not a definitive identification of the ingredient.</p></div2>

Therefore, my friend, if you greatly desire to live in this world for a long time, freeing yourself from the many indispositions and dangers to your mortal body, give attention with diligence to this, my short list of rules. Viz.:</p><p>When you get out of bed in the morning, stretch all your limbs well, because their natural warmth is the state from which they take much comfort.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Cleaning.</hi> With a comb clean your head, because rubbish and dirt that is between the scalp and the brain is removed and this cleaning greatly aids the head. Wash your hands and face with fresh water because that will give you a good color to aid nature, and blow your nose well and clear your chest by spitting, because the chest and the brain become more cleansed and purified and the speech more clear. Clean your teeth and gums well with sage or with orange rind which gives the breath a good odor and the teeth and gums are better preserved.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Perfumes.</hi> Take some time to make odorous perfumes for the brain. When it is warm use cool things, such as roses, sandalwood and similar things, and during the cold use warm things, such as cinnamon and cloves, in effect the same, because such odors greatly benefit the brain.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Garments.</hi> Dressing with respectable and good-looking clothes of light wool improves the heart. Eating sweet fennel or cloves some time in the morning results in good breath that comforts the stomach and greatly increases the desire to eat.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Electuary.</hi> Use this electuary at all times, that is <hi rend="italic">diamargariton</hi> , or an electuary with amber, borage, bugloss and similar components. Then do moderate exercise up to the first sweat because such exercise strengthens the body and augments the natural heat while the excess of bad humors is diminished. If, near the hour of taking a meal, you will empty the belly of the excess of the body, that increases the appetite and lightens the body. Thus the stomach begins to digest those foods with which your nature is familiar. Such food is better and more suitable for the stomach and is digested more easily.<ref id="ref4" n="4" target="en4" type="noteref">4</ref></p><p> <hi rend="bold">Meats.</hi> The foods that better preserve the nature of man in greater health are meat of castrated goat, veal and lamb; of birds, meat of gray partridges, pheasants, quail, Greek partridges, hens and capons. Birds of the swamp are bad and are never digested.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Eggs.</hi> Fresh hens’ eggs, given to drink, assist the brain considerably and help produce good blood.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Herbs.</hi> The green stems of herbs, not cooked too much, are good and fine and their broth is better to relieve the abdomen. To provoke urine in an orderly way, beets, borage, balsam, mint and spinach are good and are suitable at meals.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Bread.</hi> Bread should be well fermented and well cooked and not eaten warm which makes the stomach and the body worse.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Wine.</hi> Wine should be pure and small in amount. Eat without too much speed so the food can be well masticated. Drink with moderation because too much wine and food kill many. Your food and wine should be very simple and of a single kind in a course, otherwise in using very diverse foods, illness is produced.</p><p>After the meal, wash your hands well and your mouth and teeth, so that bits of food do not stay in the teeth to damage them, as often happens. If one walks enough so the the food is arranged in the bottom of the stomach, it is digested better.</p><p>When you sleep, do so with the head covered and well elevated. The first sleep should be on the right side. Get up at dawn because the mind is aroused and sharpened and the body is strengthened and health is maintained.</p><pb n="Page 12 : Folio 6v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_012.jpg" folio="6v" /><p>In the spring, take a purge. That is what preserves your health and drives away every sickness that may come. Be careful with garlic, onions and similar sour plants that are harmful to the stomach and to the brain. On other things, do not indulge in coitus too much and especially after meals. From that develops corruption of the blood and weakness of the disposition.</p><p> <hi rend="bold">Fruit.</hi> Abstain from raw fruit. That causes most serious sickness.</p><p>Do not be too melancholy which is most harmful and only makes you fall into grave indisposition and madness. Likewise, watch out for things harmful to the mind and body. By avoiding these and being careful, you will live a long time while one waits to reach the eternal life that the omnipotent and merciful God in His grace reaches out to give. This is all. Be well!</p><pb n="Page 13 : Folio 7r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_013.jpg" folio="7r" /><note place="inline"><p>[Blank.]</p></note><pb n="Page 14 : Folio 7v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_014.jpg" folio="7v" /><note place="inline"><p>[Blank.]</p></note><pb n="Page 15 : Folio 8r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_015.jpg" folio="8r" /><note place="inline"><p>[Blank.]</p></note><pb n="Page 16 : Folio 8v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_016.jpg" folio="8v" /><note place="inline"><p>[Blank.]</p></note><pb n="Page 17 : Folio 9r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_017.jpg" folio="9r" /><note place="inline"><p>[Blank.]</p></note></div2>

If, as they say, the old and modern philosophers equally have tested these secrets of nature, they are all to be found in the books of our elders. It is human nature not to be healthy, beginning from the top of the head down to the tips of the toes. I do not speak so much of the interior parts of the body but of illnesses of the exterior, beginning with the top of the head and going to the eyes, ears, nose, teeth and tongue, then to paralysis, the throat, catarrh, indisposition of the stomach, liver, abdomen, spleen, illnesses of the womb, the distress of kidney stone, difficulty in urination, boils and growths, wens, abcesses of the nipples, problems and swelling with the legs, corns, dislocated joints, broken bones, and damaged nerves. These remedies are discussed: unguents, plasters, oils, medicinal powders, the power of every herb, distillation of all waters, a remedy against the French sickness, the best elixir of life, laxatives, syrups, juleps, pills and how to make them with wine for each infirmity, and the power of the dead, not the living, wolf, and the remedies for some infirmities of horses. These you will understand in reading this.</p><p>Through a gift of God, I, a faithful Christian, have considered the usefulness and value that each remedy has. As a wise pilgrim, I have gathered all these secrets now to be found in this, my little book, in which is included the many powers created by nature, the merits of which until the present have not been generally noticed. But take those that please you in their action and have confidence in the living God who created all from nothing. By working with these, not once but often, you will see it manifest that these are for the most part tested as things produced by nature and preserved with divine aid, for which should be rendered glorious and eternal praises for the origin of all created things. Jesus Christ lives and reigns for all eternity. So be it.+</p></div2>

For 15 to 20 days in a row the patient shoud eat this herb at meals or before meals with bread or in fritters or in whatever way he wants to eat it. Begin to do this 15 to 20 days before the full moon and watch carefully, if you can, to learn the day, the hour and the place where the moon rises. On that day, hour and location of the moon, draw blood from the patient from the vein under the tongue. Do this 3 times in a row, that is for 3 moons. This is verified and tested and greatly praised by experienced doctors who say that at that point the moon stirs all our blood and doing this bleeding under the tongue may diminish the bad blood which ascends to the brain, and so free the body of this kind of sickness, little by little. Warn the patient not to cohabit with women because that has very adverse effects. That is said to me by one who tested it.</p><p type="div3" id="id119525"> <hi rend="bold">Another for falling sickness.</hi> Take leaves and seed of the herb dragon root or the root or some of its berries and give it to the sick one to drink.

Put everything together and give it to the patient to drink with 3 ounces of red wine with broth or soup. If it is a little child make it smell rue repeatedly. Then rub some bread with roasted oil and give it to eat. It helps greatly. Then take a nail from the coffin of a dead man and make it into a ring and put it on the marriage finger and it greatly helps in this falling sickness. Have the patient wear around the neck this little charm, viz: '+ Amen + treat + your + old age + gently + remove + fevers + disease + and also repel + sudden + death'.

All these should be washed and clean and cut finely and boiled together until the malvasia is reduced in half. Then add two thirds of the items written below, viz.:1 ½ ounces each of galingale and musk and 1 ounce each of cloves, cinnamon and ginger and let all these items cook on a very slow fire until the rest of the malvasia is used up. Then strain it through a fine cloth and put the remaining third of the items into the pure oil that has been strained and add 1 lb. of ordinary oil to the above. Then it should be put in the sun, well-covered, for several days and it will be made. With this oil rub the sick person all over the stomach and the back up to the head, going down as far as the kidney and the edge of the kidney. Through God's grace soon he will get better.</p></div2>

Rub with the fat and the flesh joins. Rub and the flesh mends. Rub and it is cooled and the flesh binds.' In the name of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.”</p><p>Flax is the fiber that should be used to tie. Take 3 threads and lard fat, bind around it with these 3 threads and with it, cold, rub the hurt place that is bruised and sore if the flesh and bone are not broken, but only bruised or cut.

Then remove it and wrap it well in 4 to 6 cabbage leaves or good parchment. Then dip the package in water and remove it quickly. Clear off the hearth and put it in the center. Cover it with embers and warm ashes so it is protected from the fire and let it stay for 2 hours, more or less, according to how hot the fire is. Watch that it does not burn or it will be consumed. Then remove it, unwrap the coverings and clean off the ashes as best you can. Put it between two chopping boards or two little planks and press it as hard as you can and also put it under the press to extract the last juice, as much as you can. Put in 3 <hi rend="italic">quatrini</hi> of verdigris, cut very finely, and incorporate it well. Then strain it, still warm, through a fine cloth and save it in a little pot, continuing to stir it until it becomes cold so the verdigris does not go to the bottom but stays distributed. When you want to use it on the head that has ringworm, do it in this way: rub the head with ringworm every other evening, gently rubbing well into the scalp and put on a leaf of cabbage or parchment and a nightcap over that. Wash the head 2 or 3 times a week with mild lye boiled with roots of dock. When you wash it put in a fistful of very fine bran and then dry it very well. When you wash it, pull the hair lightly, so each time those which are most affected will improve some, so little by little you will remove it. When the hair is dry, rub the skin well with the grease so it penetrates and in this way the roots of the hair are aged and removed because the root is what holds the sickness. Then when the head is clean it will regrow all the hair more beautiful than it was at first and in greater amount, and you will be cured. Then rub the head with this oil: take 2 or 3 live lizards, that is Ligurian green lizards, and drown them in a pot full of ordinary oil and boil it in front of the fire until they are well broken apart. Remove it from the fire and leave it in the sun for 15 to 20 days. Rub it in carefully every evening where you want the hair to come and it will grow again thick and long. This recipe has been very, very effective many, many times. Tested by me Master Apothecary Andrea.</p><p type="div3" id="id208105"> <hi rend="bold">Another to remove ringworm, no less good than the one above.</hi> Take pork lard, as above, and cut it into thin slices. Thread on a skewer one slice of lard and one leaf of climbing ivy. Then put it on the fire and turn it very slowly. Put a dish underneath that has some very strong vinegar in it and let it cook that way. When the pork is nearly cooked, remove it from the fire and put the tip of the skewer in the dish and hold it upright and move the fire away from the bottom and drain all the fat into the vinegar. Then put the vinegar and the fat together in a little pot and save it for your needs. When you rub the head of a ringworm sufferer, rub it in the evening and rub it well on the scalp and cover it as described above. Then make some lye to wash the head 2 or 3 times a week. When you have made your lye and strained it, boil it again with a little rock alum, grape leaves, savin and roots or leaves of danewort, one handful each, and a jug of good white wine. Then wash the head with this lye. When it is dry rub it with the grease. In the morning rub the head with warm oil of juniper and, through the grace of God, soon you will cure the greasy ringworm.</p></div2>

Saint Peter answered and said, 'Lord, I have the fever.' Christ said, 'Say this prayer and at once you will be freed.'

In the name of the most holy night in which the Virgin Mary gave birth when Christ was born. Christ died and Christ rose again and commanded that those with wounds be healthy and well cared for without putrefaction and chills, without fever and without vomiting blood, without broken bones and without any pain or illness. So Christ orders and the blessed Virgin Mary prays. Just as the foreign unbeliever pierced the side of our Lord Jesus Christ with a spear and the blessed wound healed and did not lead to putrefaction but healthy flesh grew in honor of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, such wounds will be healed well without any scar by the seven words which he said on the cross to God, Father omnipotent, 'Forgive those who know not what they do.' Amen. ' I say today you will be in Paradise.' ' <hi rend="italic">Ely, ely lama zabatani.'</hi> ' Woman, behold your Son.' 'I thirst.' 'Into your hands I commend my soul.' 'It is finished.'

Then take the water and say, 'I bless you water through Jesus Christ, the Son of him who is our only Lord, who in Cana in Galilee, as a sign of his miraculous power, changed you into wine, who walked over you with his feet and was baptized by John in the Jordan, and you are all in one with the blood coming forth from his side. He said to the disciples that it cures all wounds. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.' Again, 'I bless you, water, in the most holy name of the Virgin Mary +. I bless you + water + in the name of all the holy works of God. I bless you + water + in the name of that most holy night when the blessed Virgin Mary gave birth to his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

I bless + you by the resurrection and by the decree that he made when he ordered that without any impurity, danger, pain, chills, any cut nerves will be well healed and clean and without any illness the wounds will be healed. In this way also wounds upon which will have been poured out this water for all maladies be healed, in the name of the Father + Son + and Holy Spirit. Amen.' These words are said as an invocation over a dish full of water with a Pater Noster and an Ave Maria. First wet the clothes that you place on the wound and the patient should tell the circumstances and say 3 Pater Noster with the Ave Maria. Put the cloths on in the form of a cross. Treat 2 times a day and put the soiled cloths on the fire and no cloths from women. You know what that means.</p><p>Also this water is powerful for the person who has white menstruations or problems with the kidneys, by drinking one glass in the morning early in the form of a syrup with 3 Pater Noster.

Put in 1 ounce of sublimate, 2 ounces of rock alum and 1 ounce of salt. This is the principle preparation and everything should be finely ground. Put this flask in front of the fire on a brick and let it boil uncovered until it reduces down from the neck. Remove it from the fire and let it cool. Then put therein the juice of 6 lemons and of 3 or 4 sour oranges and the whites of 4 fresh eggs, well beaten, and shake the flask very well upside down so that everything is incorporated well. Then strain it through fine linen cloth and return it to the flask and put it in the sun, covered, for 3 or 4 days and it will be made, a noble, high class water for itch, perfect for any need. It lasts a very long time and never spoils and will be very odorous and white. When you want to use it, shake it up and wet a little sponge in this water and squeeze it out a little and bathe only the joints of the wrists carefully instead of the whole body, alternately on one evening and not on the next. Rub yourself with this for 3 or 4 evenings, according to how much rash you have and the last time that you do not want to do any more, wash all your body with good lye and change to other clothes and all the itching will go away. Where you have sores, that is oily scabs, wet around and around, but do not touch them which will make them irritated. You should know that this water has such virtue that after you have bathed the first time you will not feel such itching again because it clears away that corrupt blood that flows with the thin humor through the flesh. This pulls water out from the joints and makes them dry, without harm to the rest of the body which remains free and healthy. Also where this water does touch, it will make the flesh white and fade the dark signs on the body and make the flesh very sweet smelling and spotless. This has been tested. When you would like to bathe some little child, do not shake the water but take from that on top that is clearer and less strong and gentler and the child will be pleased and soon will be cured. You should know that the escort of our Lord, Pope Clement VII, and also his steward of the holy palace who were both treated by me were healed and cured more quickly than one would believe possible by this water which was made with musk roses. This water was much praised by them without knowing the composition. If you do not make it with rose water, make it with plain water from the cistern and it also will take on the odor and will have the same effect. In either form it has been tested many, many times.<ref id="ref64" n="64" target="en64" type="noteref">64</ref></p><p type="div3" id="id213825"> <hi rend="bold">Another water for simple itching.</hi> Take a little carafe full of cistern water and put therein 2 ounces of rock alum and ½ ounce of salt with everything finely ground, and boil it on a brick facing the fire until it reduces one fourth. Then remove it from the fire and when it is cool, strain it through a piece of fine linen and save it for your needs. In the evening when you go to sleep, wash carefully all the joints of the arms and legs and the wrists on alternate evenings. When all the itching has stopped on the body, on the last evening, take a bath and change clothes. In these days be careful of your diet. Do not eat harmful things, not green vegetables, nor fruit, nor pork meat, but for 6 to 8 days drink cooling fresh waters with ½ ounce of rose honey added which will help your stomach greatly and will cool the liver so that all this material will be dried up and will go away and you will not notice it. This has been used many, many times on various persons and it has worked wonderfully in poor and rich persons. Be well.</p></div2>

I took the longer of these roots, not too thick but slender, being smooth without other little roots around. I washed and cleaned these carefully, wrapped them up straight in a sheet of white parchment and left them to dry in the shade. When they were dry, they were polished and smooth. Then I took one of these roots and smeared it with honey and put it into the tip of the penis until it was into the penis for 4 fingers' depth with a thread hanging out right in the flap of the breeches. When the desire to urinate came, he drew out this root and urinated a lot and easily. This root was enlarging and keeping the opening of the penis large. Then another root smeared with honey was put in again. The first root was washed and cleaned carefully and again wound up in parchment, and as it dried it was as good as at first.

The herbs should be cut finely. Put everything in a little bag of fine, loosely-knit linen tied with a thread to the top of a wine barrel and fill this barrel with must of good, pure white wine that has not been fermented and let it ferment for 1 month or more in the barrel with the little bag in it and every evening fill it up with some must so that it heats better and purifies itself and throws down all the bad lees. When it will not ferment any more and becomes cold and clear, remove the little bag and strain the wine carefully so it does not become turbid. Then return it to the barrel and stopper it well at the top so it keeps better. When it seems to you that you feel the pain of the stone in the bladder or in the kidney or have some other difficulty with urination, drink a glass of this wine early in the morning, staying in bed and reposing for at least 2 hours. Depending on the improvement that you feel, drink it for 2 or 3 mornings and not more because it will overheat the liver. If you think that you may be drinking too much, drink it one morning and not the next so that it has less effect on you. This wine aids greatly in breaking the stone in the bladder and in the kidney and causes copious urination. You will feel the stones going out of the penis. If the effect is not rapid enough with the remedies above, it is appropriate to use some poultices or ointments on the pubic region or on the penis or kidney.

Take it up with a little sugar in a syringe that should be clean inside. Put it in the opening of the penis and hold your hand firm and inject it with force. Do it in this way 4 to 5 times in the morning and the evening and you will cause urination. By protecting yourself from adverse things, through God's grace, you will be cured because one who has tested it renders true testimony. For 9 months he tried but never found anything that might help him and a large swelling like an egg came under the penis near the testicles and material was going in that place whenever he moved his bowels or urinated. Much material gathered there in such a way that a fistula formed and it broke open and through that opening everything exited and nothing through the penis. He was thought to be lost to illness and never more to be a man. Now, with the aid of God, having him obedient to the doctor and using on him the above-described water and the electuary written below and with the good care of the doctor, he was cured but it took many days. But at certain times he was feeling again some pricking within and this was at certain months. It is true that when he was urinating or when the material was coming out, he was constrained to press the penis which by itself was not able to make anything come out. When so much had been fixed for him, he was very content to have received such comfort from God and from men. He would watch and know that, when this material was burning him it was not cured, and if by chance it would happen, he would at once look to his first remedy, to refrain from coitus, to wash himself, to take the beverages, to use the ointments, to take the electuaries and other appropriate powders, because in truth all these remedies have been tested. I give them all to you, for in truth no others have this power.</p></div2>

Boil it until it is reduced 1/3 and remove it from the fire and strain it and press everything in a little press and extract all the substance. Put all this boiled liquid again in a pot and put in a young fowl to cook, dressed as usual, and let it cook well until the meat is detached from the bone. Then remove it and clean it well from the bones and grind it very finely in a mortar and put in fine sugar so that it appears to you that it is made in the form of an electuary. If needed add some of the boiled liquid to distemper it when you give it or otherwise with chicken broth or with red wine. Give it early in the morning. Then at once give a glass to drink of the water written below when it is cold. Through God's grace you will see a very good result. This is a very rare secret and few persons at this time are not healed by this electuary which is effective in a few days so a person might wish to test this electuary alone. It heals freely, quickly and without taking other appropriate things. It is true that I did many tests and I cured many persons. Through God's grace, they were cured completely and quickly and I tell you this from observing it.</p></div2>

If by chance the woman is not able to carry the child to its time and that during this time it may be lost without much cause, the woman should carry this stone on her back so that it touches her flesh and she will carry the baby, through God's grace, to its time. Then if the stone is removed as she begins to feel the pains, make it hang on one of her thighs, as described above. If the woman may know that she may have too much heat or warmth and this is the reason that she may not carry the baby to its time, she should eat almost all things cooling during this time. This aids in carrying the baby so it is not detached from the kidneys and stays to the end of its time.

If the gravid woman is upright on her feet, call her and watch well which foot she puts first before the other. If she puts the right foot forward first, it is a male in her body and her body will be pointed toward the front.

Then say these 3 little verses, looking at her while she is silent. 'Increate Father, increate Son, increate Holy Spirit, one without creation. Infinite Father, infinite Son, infinite Holy Spirit, one infinity. Eternal Father, eternal Son and eternal Holy Spirit.' Then note well if she puts her hand to her waist to make some adjustment or to arrange something around her neck. If that happens, judge it and say to yourself that she will deliver a male. If she makes a sign from the waist downward, judge the baby to be female. If by chance the woman does not make the sign clearly, say the above words one more time. At the end of 3 times you will see some of these signs appear. If she makes them above the waist, it is judged to be male and if they are made below the waist, it is judged to be female. This sign has been used many times and I have never been in doubt when it is made. It is a simple and straight-forward method and it is true and tested.</p></div2>

Because this is an uneven number, you should say she will give birth to a male. If the number is even, say it will be female. This is an infallible rule drawn from astrology many times by men of every faith and it has been tested.</p><p>Also if you may be told that the child, either male or female, is blind in one eye or crippled or lame, only ask the name and look at how many vowels are within the name.

You will have a material as yellow as gold which is the best to use on every sore. It destroys the afflicted flesh and then alters and heals the good flesh and it does not hurt.

To assure that it is washed well inside with this wine, the penis should be relaxed. Then have a little candle of wax of such size that it can enter the penis and on the tip of the candle make a little duct and put therein some of the unguent described above and send it in very slowly until it reaches the fleshy growth and there turn the candle so the unguent remains on the bad part to break it up without distress.

Note that the man who has sickness in this member must want to be cured completely, quickly and well. Know that it is expedient for him to live his life more or less as if he had a continuous fever, because the member is very excitable. It senses immediately what you have eaten and that affects its action. If you eat things harmful, it feels that at once and you will be aware of it because you will feel the pain. Therefore you need to eat all things cooling and do not drink wine, nor eat fruit, nor sour things, nor legumes, nor wheat, nor pork meat, nor make use of women because all these things are very harmful. Eat broth with eggs, bread soup with almond milk or melon seeds, fresh eggs, young chickens and other delicate meat and barley water or boiled water with nothing added until it begins to cure.

Then press all the herbs well under the press and extract all the substance and put everything together and make a least a jug of this boiled liquid. Put one part warm in a little bowl and soak in it the relaxed penis of one who has a sore place and of one who urinates blood and it will soon stop. When you go to sleep, wet some cloths in the liquid and wrap the penis. Do this several times and soon you will be cured of smarting of the penis and urinating blood. But do not eat harmful things, but eat all cooling things. Do not eat salted vegetables nor salted meat and do not drink wine and you will be freed. You should know that sickness comes to a man's member sometimes through the misery of any rash around the prepuce that is scratched and that becomes a nodule developing infection. If the man does not clean himself well, in that case boils and irritation arise and the man rubs them and the humor moves in and makes the illness arise. This also develops in the vagina of the woman more easily than in the man because she cannot clean herself as the man can. Therefore she should be prudent in everything regarding similar matters. Be advised to use the above boiled liquid in the way said above and you will always stay clean and will live without fear and be content.</p></div2>

Say it with the Pater Noster. When you put on the plaster, put on the truss with more padding and tighten it well. Every morning take ½ spoonful of this powder each time in the form of a warm syrup with wine or broth and stay in repose and sleep if you can. Viz., 2 drams each of myrtle leaves, cypress nuts and mummy, ½ dram each of cloves, parsley, ginger and Indian leaf, 1 dram of dragon's blood gum and 1 dram of elemi gum. Make very fine powder of all of the above things, well sifted and incorporated. Continue to take this as described early in the morning and continue for a month or more while you wear the plaster. It will be useful to you to take the usual laxative during this time so that the body stays soft, without hard effort to go from the body. So for the first 3 days stay in bed and stay with the back straight and with the head lowered. Have great courage in these 3 days that it will help you greatly when the relaxed parts of the abdomen are freshly adhered together and more easily one regains health and is cured.</p><p>During the time that you will stay in this condition, it is to your advantage to keep from all those things that are adverse, not too much activity that is fatiguing, especially to your back. Do not be with your wife while wearing the truss and do not go without it.

Grind them in a mortar with the shells and their lids, everything as they are. When they are well ground, add 1 handful of dittany roots and grind them together so they are well incorporated. Then add 3 ounces of cherry gum, which first should be dried and made into fine powder, and incorporate this with the other things in the mortar until it seems to you that everything is united well together. If it seems to you that they are not well ground or that they cannot be ground, cut them on a slab as is done to beat lard so that they become well ground and incorporated together and the plaster will be made in this way. Then spread it on a smooth cloth or a little smooth sheepskin. Put it on the rupture in the pubic area with several layers and bind with a truss of fustian or smooth cotton cloth so it stays tight and close. Stay in repose as much as you can and do not do much that is fatiguing and do not partake of things that are adverse, such as women, legumes, sour fruit and pork and be careful of all things causing gas. By taking care of yourself, through God's grace, soon it will be cured. This remedy is intended for those who are ruptured recently, in a year or so, and especially it is very appropriate to use with little children. It is said that they are cured, if they have no other sickness, at the end of 2 months or less, according to whether the infirmity is large or small. Change the plaster at least every 10 or 15 or 20 days because the plaster will heat up and turn bad and develop odor because the snails will begin to putrefy. For this reason you should change it a little each time. This plaster will last longer in the winter than in the summer in this respect, because you will need to change it every 8 days in the summer. Follow the rules and you will be cured.</p><p type="div3" id="id232710"> <hi rend="bold">Another plaster similar to the above which is no less good.</hi> Viz.

Then put in 1 ounce of good theriac and incorporate well together until it hardens and watch carefully because, when it begins to boil, it seems that it wants to bubble over. It thickens as you stir until it pulls away at the bottom. Then remove it from the fire and will be a perfect plaster. Use it in the way that you have the one above and it will work well.

This is the way. Take juice from cabbage leaves and mix it with the oil and put it on as a poultice with juice of wormwood and the substance from ground snails. It helps greatly and will cure rapidly.</p><p>Note that many of the above virtues of this oil are nearly the same as those of balsam and in practice you will know its great power by testing it and becoming an expert. Some make this oil in an easier way but I do not believe it to be of such great virtue. They take old olive oil, the oldest they can find, and as much pure and clean tamarind flowers as can be put in the oil. Put it in a pot and let it stay in the sun, day and night, for 20 to 30 days, well covered. Then put it underground for a month in a warm place where the sun beats on it. Then bring it out and strain the oil carefully through a double thickness of cloth and put it again in the sun for a month to purify and it will be made, very odorous and rich. When you use it for all your needs, make it warm and you may even tell the patient to drink it because its virtue is to warm and comfort human feelings.</p><head>A wine to open a fistula and cure an ulcer.</head><p>Take 1 ½ jugs each of strong vinegar and sharp white wine and put in 8 ounces of slaked lime in powder and boil it until it reduces 1/3. Remove it from the fire and let it settle. Strain it so it is very clear. Then put in all these things made into very fine powder, that is, 1 ounce each of rock salt, ammonium chloride and saltpeter and 3 ounces of ash from burnt feathers. Let it stand for one whole day in a well-covered vessel in a warm place so they are well incorporated. Then distill through felt or strain it finely. Then put 1 ½ ounces of iron rust into the wine and it will give the color red to all the wine and it will be made. When you use it, wet some cloths well and put them on and in the sore and treat in the evening and morning. This wine has the strength to remove bad flesh and induce good. It even cures the scab that comes in the rear. If you make some copper become red hot in the fire and extinguish it in this wine, the copper will become white in color and will appear like silver. This has been tested. In this wine you have a cure for the above infirmity.<ref id="ref124" n="124" target="en124" type="noteref">124</ref></p><p type="div3" id="id234353"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> Garlic and sage cooked with rose oil and ground and rubbed on an ulcer remove the pain.</p><p type="div3" id="id234366"> <hi rend="bold">Another powder against fistula and canker.</hi> Take 1 lb. of quicklime, 1 ounce of copper sulfate, ½ ounce of sulfur, 4 ounces of powdered orpiment, 6 ounces of barley flour, 8 ounces of white honey and 3 ounces of strong vinegar. Incorporate everything together and make a paste. Make little balls and dry them thoroughly in the warm oven. Then regrind them and make very fine powder and save this for your needs. When you wish to use the powder in the illness of fistula or canker, put a little in the top of the tent that you put on the sore and treat once a day or twice a day. Know that the powder eats, corrodes and consumes all the bad flesh and makes the good grow.</p><p type="div3" id="id234400"> <hi rend="bold">Another against fistula.</hi> Take branches of green ivy without leaves, cut them minutely and distill them in glass.

For this it is said that it aids stutterers, those born in great numbers in the mountains of Genoa and in the Duchy of Urbino in the mountains. You should know that this herb is most powerful in sickness of the womb, especially in prolapse. Giving a spoonful of the powder to women to drink in warm broth or wine at the time of the displacement of the womb, rapidly relieves and cures the sickness of the womb.</p><p>Also it is powerful and wonderful for those who have hernias in the scrotum or in the groin. Make a powder of its roots or of the herb or both mixed, and give a spoonful to the patient to drink in the morning at dawn with warm broth or wine in the form of a syrup and again in the evening. Continue this drinking for a month or more, until at the end you feel cured. It may seem to you that in the first days all the intestines want to come out of the body through that sick part and you are advised to put on a band or truss and wear it continually, day and night, with it thick and well-wrapped and tight. If you are able to stay a while in repose, you will be cured more quickly of the fissure or rupture. Watch what you eat and keep from adverse things and, with the aid of God, you will be cured quickly because this has been tested. For those who do not have fluent speech, holding some of the herb in the mouth and eating it helps greatly. For little children who do not have fluent language, placing these little leaves on the tongue will make the tongue flexible. This is very well tested and true.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id234518" type="ss1"><head>The herb adder's tongue fern or <hi rend="italic">argentina</hi> that is ribless.</head><p>This herb has different names in different locations, that is, adder's tongue fern or silverweed or ribless fern, because it does not have veins as have other leaves. This herb is well known in Lombardy and especially in the Piedmont. It is found beginning in the month of May and continues until the first half of June. Then it is no more to be seen. This herb is soft and flexible to touch and oily and its leaf is similar to plantain but smaller. It does not make a stalk and grows adventitiously in the meadows and it is very beautiful to see there. But it is more beautiful for its virtues because it has marvelous efficacy in healing wounds and especially new ones and also those made by stabs. You make oil from its leaves in this way. Take ordinary oil, the oldest that you have, and put it in a vessel with the herb. Cover the vessel well and leave it for a month or more in the sun. Then boil it for an hour on a water bath. In this way the herb is cooked and amplifies its power. Leave it in the sun for 8 to 10 days and it will be made. Save it as a treasure. This oil is powerful, when rubbed on warm, for all difficulties of the eyes and is especially powerful in fresh wounds and in all stabs where the wound is narrow. Put it on with a tent and soon it will heal without distress. It removes the pain and removes muscle spasms especially effectively in old wounds. The herb can be made into powder, otherwise the herb itself is eaten with a fresh egg or broth. Continuing it heals hernias marvelously when the rupture is rubbed with very warm oil. It is put on thickly and tied very tightly and carefully and, with care and with the aid of God, the rupture will be cured. Do this with confidence that this has been tested. It has many other virtues.<ref id="ref125" n="125" target="en125" type="noteref">125</ref></p></div2>

In the Greek vocabulary it is called <hi rend="italic">galiopsi</hi> which is to say 'milk'. It has been shown many times to cure the spleen. I tell you that you should gather some of this herb in the half moon and dry it in the shade and wind and make very fine powder of it. Take one spoonful in a fresh egg early in the morning and continue for 15 to 20 days. Do not do anything intemperate. You should know that in the section on curing the spleen, I say first purge the spleen and soon, with the aid of God, you will be cured. If you will eat the plant raw, you will be cured sooner. This has been tested.<ref id="ref126" n="126" target="en126" type="noteref">126</ref></p></div2>
<div2 id="id234634" type="ss1"><head>The herb scabiosa and some of its virtues.</head><p>Take the herb scabiosa in the waning of the moon when it is nearly mature and dry it in the shade and make very fine powder of it. Put it on a sore or ulcerated leg that first should be washed several times with warm wine. It heals this wonderfully. If you put it on a gall on the back of a horse with powder of a burnt old shoe, very soon it makes a cure so that the skin returns. Likewise, if you grind the herb between two lodestones and put it on warm, it soon cures. It is good in either way, in herb or in powder. Also it is powerful in distress of the stomach and especially in catarrh that is in the lungs or in heavy cough. Eat the herb or drink some of its distilled water. It is of great help in removing any kind of itch. With the powder one makes a good unguent and it has many other properties that I do not write down.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id234645" type="ss1"><head>The herb rue and some of its tested virtues.</head><p>Rue of the gardens is warm and dry in the third degree and the wild rue in the fourth degree. Taking some of the cultivated variety removes flatulence and increases the humidity of the body and greatly helps the lower intestine. Drinking a decoction of it takes away the flatulence and the tortion and pain in the body caused by viscous humors. Cooked in oil and made into suppositories, it dissolves the excessive flatulence that accompanies excessive humors that envelop the intestines. It is also powerful in cloudiness in the eyes and in poor vision in any way that you eat it, either as the herb or in powder or cooked. Also bathing the eyes with some of its distilled water alternately with rose water in the morning, clarifies the vision greatly and also has many other virtues.</p></div2>

Do it in the morning and evening and soon your pain will lift for that time and it will not be as serious at other times and, by continuing it, you will be cured through God's grace.</p><head>Against the pain of gout, a most worthy unguent to rub wherever the pain may be.</head><p>Take 2 ounces of Venetian turpentine, 1 ounce of ground ordinary salt, 2 lb. each of ground tartaric acid from the wine cask and the oldest olive oil that you can find and 1 handful of dill. Boil all these things together until it is reduced one third. Then strain it through a fine strainer and put into this strained mixture 1 ounce each of strained goose fat and bear fat, 1 ½ ounces of marrow from deer and 2 ounces of clean wax. Incorporate all the above things warm and make an unguent and seal it carefully. Rub the painful gouty place, heating the palm of the hand and rubbing the sore place lightly with this ointment because the oil penetrates more easily through the natural warmth of the hand and it will help greatly in serious pain so you will not feel it.</p><p type="div3" id="id236161"> <hi rend="bold">Another, a very perfect ointment to lift the pain of gout.</hi> Take a neutered, live bitch that is very fat. Kill it and remove the skin, head, feet and the insides. Boil it in a cauldron of water, large enough so that water does not have to be added, until it is well cooked and falls apart. Remove the cauldron from the fire and let it cool. Then collect all the fat that is on top as something precious and save it. Take 2 ounces of this fat and 1 ounce of fine rose water and reboil the fat and the water together on a slow fire until it forms an unguent. With this ointment rub the place that has gouty pain 3 or 4 times a day and rub with the warm palm of the hand. This makes it penetrate more easily and it helps the patient and the pain is soon gone.</p><p>Again, the ointment above may be made with a dead fox and boiled in a large cauldron with enough water. Do not remove anything, neither skin, nor head, nor feet, nor the insides. All these things are good and helpful, as is said above. Collect all the fat that forms on the water when it is cold and save it. It keeps for a long time and is firm and very penetrating. Use it as above or put it together with the other which works better to remove the pain and even has some other virtues for other suffering and pain. This has been tested many times.</p></div2>

<div2 id="id236579" type="ss1"><head>Prayer to cure gouty sciatica wherever it may be, and rapidly.</head><p>Say, and have the patient say, 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Maria. Then say, 'In the name of God and the Holy Trinity and the always glorious Virgin Mary, free me of this sickness early in the morning and lead me early to the clear water. There we will go and 3 good deeds will be recorded. God save me from 3 evils, that is from running water, from burning fire and from powerful lords. I swear to God omnipotent and to the Virgin Mary, give me strength for one month and to be patient, not to eat garlic, nor lentils, nor head nor tail of animal, in the name of the Father, + Son + and Holy Spirit, + Amen.' Say this for 3 times each morning with the Pater Noster and continue for 3 mornings and each time that you deliver it, spit in running water if you can. Stay a whole month without eating legumes of any kind, nor sour fruit of any kind, nor head nor tail of fish. Eat bread of plain wheat without any other blend and drink wine and not water and stay away from women. Do this in the morning as early as one can. If the person is completely crippled so he is not able to move from bed, take a bowl of clear water and make him look at it and deliver the prayer and he spits in it and this is thrown away. The first night he will feel very troubled and this is a good sign of rapid cure. At the end of 6 to 8 days, little by little he will attain a cure even if the illness is old and wherever it is on the body, so with the aid of God, soon you will cure. If, by chance, he breaks the vow, the serious illness will return to him anew and he must return to the beginning of the prayer. Five persons have been cured in this time without doing anything else of whom 3 were elderly and were not able to move from bed and the other 2 were carried to a little running water when the prayer was delivered, spitting in the water 3 times in the morning before the sun came up and these were cured without taking any other medicine. You who want to say the prayer, get up in the morning at dawn and make the patient get up if you can. If not, do as is said above and of this be sure that all may be healed of the gouty sciatica which is caused by humidity and may be from coldness. Wherever it be in the body, all will be healed through God's grace by observing completely the things said above and with no other treatments.</p></div2>

When they are red hot, push them into olive oil that is the oldest you can find in a basin of clay that you have prepared. Do this 3 or 4 times. Then let them dry and grind them and make very fine powder. Put the powder in a glass retort and seal it very well and let the seal dry. Then put it in the alchemist's furnace fitted with a cover and a receptacle with the fitting tight so it does not let out gas from any side. Then start the fire, very slowly at the beginning. Increase the fire little by little and notice that 3 kinds of oil will come out. The first will be clear, the second red and the third dark. You should know that almost all the virtue is in the first oil, the virtues of which in part are written below, as you see.</p></div2>

Also it is valuable in all problems of the ears and kills worms in children when the wrists are bathed with it. Also it is useful in paralysis by drinking some of it and bathing the limbs of the patient. Also it is useful in cold sciatica by rubbing with it very warm. Also it is powerful for the spleen when prepared gum ammoniac is added. Then rubbing repeatedly with this oil very warm in a short time takes out distress and clears up the spleen quickly. Also it is useful to resolve all hard abcesses. Also it is effective in a seizure, placing some in the mouth or in the nose. Also it helps the memory when the fontanel of the head is rubbed with it. Also it is powerful to draw out a dead baby by putting this oil with wet cloths in the vagina and also on the private parts. It kills the worms inside.

Bake them hot so they become very red. Then quench them in ordinary oil at least 2 times. Then grind them and make very fine powder. Put it in a retort in a large still and use it in the usual way and distill oil with a slow fire. This oil according to the philosophers is called plain <hi rend="italic">olio laterino</hi> . Put this oil in a pan of iron or a frying pan and if the oil is up to one pound, add another pound of powered yellow sulfur and stir well together with a rod of wood until it becomes like honey and put this liquor on a marble slab. Cut it up as finely as the size of beans. Then put it back in the retort and let it putrefy for 3 days. Distill it with the retort of the still on ashes and first keep the fire low. Begin increasing the flames little by little until all has distilled and it will be made. Then distill it on a hot bath and in this way you will have oil of sulfur and at the bottom of the pot it will be ruby red. Distill it in the retort with a very hot fire and you will have oil of sulfur like a ruby in all its perfection.</p><p type="div3" id="id239084"> <hi rend="bold">Another way to prepare oil of sulfur.</hi> Take 12 lb. of good quality salt and grind it finely and put it in a stone vessel and put thereon some warm water so it is all dissolved. Then pour it through felt until it becomes clear. Then thicken it on a slow fire and use enough fire so it precipitates. Then form it into a rod and grind it anew and make it into very fine powder. Again put it in a stone vessel and dissolve it in water and collect this in a glass vessel. Take powdered yellow sulfur and soak it 7 times in this water, mixing and drying it in the sun 7 times. Put this in a retort and distill it with a slow fire into a large receptacle. The first distillation will come out as clear water and does not have much power. Then the red oil will come out and you should increase the fire until all of this comes out and it will be made.

Put the vessel in the center of a glass bowl, as you see. Put on its glass cap, luted below the thickness of a thumb, or a large funnel that receives all the fumes so that nothing is lost. Then start the fire under the sulfur with a candle. The cap should not touch the bowl by the distance of half a finger and the vessel should not touch the bottom of the bowl so the oil that falls out does not touch it. If it does, it will dry up and you will have nothing. Set it on a little piece of glass and in this way you will be able to collect it. You can lift up the cap when you want to kindle the fire and then lower it and hang it on a nail or tie it with twine. Heat it very slowly and the oil will fall down and you can collect it, little by little. Save it in a large glass bottle.

<div2 id="id239826" type="ss1"><head>Oil of tartar to whiten the skin.</head><p>Take 6 lb. of tartar, that is the lees of white wine, and wash it with good white wine. Then dry it in the shade. Then put it in a clean pot, sealed, and put it in the pottery kiln until it is well calcined. Then put it in a pointed little linen sack and put it in a humid place. If you wish to use it to clear up the face, put in at least 8 to 10 fresh egg whites. Preserve this oil and you will have the means to make your skin white.</p></div2>

Clean it and put it to heat, that is to calcine, in a kiln for pottery. When it is cold, remove it. Then put it in a large glass flask and also in a little sack of cloth pointed at the bottom. Put it in a humid place, fenced or underground, so animals or other bad things or air or wind cannot get to it and it will soon become wet and will yield the oil at the end of 20 to 30 days, sooner or later according to whether it is settled in a suitable place to receive humidity easily. Tie the sack in the air so it does not touch the glass on any side. Strain it into a glass flask and little by little empty it into a bottle. It will be clear and transparent and will look like clear water. Save this as something dear. When it will not give out more oil, take the substance that remains in the sack and reboil it in a a pot of water, that is with 3 lb. of water to 1 lb. of this material, and boil until it reduces 1/3. Wash all the body with this water and it will remove all itching and all dark or red marks or moles and it will make all your flesh white as it used to be. If you will wash the face and chest with it it will make the skin lustrous and clear and stretch out every wrinkle and it will make you appear younger than you are. If you add a little dried rock alum in this water and wash out a spot made by wine or ink, wherever and whatever it is it will soon be removed and will be seen no more.</p><p type="div3" id="id239887"> <hi rend="bold">The virtues of the above-described oil of tartar.</hi> First, it is useful for removing all marks or the edges of wounds when it is rubbed on warm several times and it even removes all black marks on the body.</p><p type="div3" id="id239902"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> To remove spots made by ink on any cloth, wet the spots and let it stay a little until the oil has penetrated well. Then wash it with fresh water, rubbing it a little, and if the spot does not go away at first, do it two times and it will disappear, be the spot made from ink, wine or grease. If the spot is on cloth or fabric of silk, apply this oil 2 or 3 times but do not rub it and wash with clear water and it will go away.</p><p type="div3" id="id239913"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> This oil is powerful to brighten the painted figure, that is by bathing with a fine, clean sponge, otherwise with a soft brush. Put it on the drawing or other painting in the same way as a liquid varnish. You should know that this helps brighten all the colors and all the painting seems to be renewed as soon as it is dry. This has been tested many times.</p><p type="div3" id="id239924"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It is powerful to aid all nerves which have been torn or retracted by any infirmity. When it is used very warm it soon helps and cures. I have tested this on my own hand twice, only the ointment was very cold and I am more than half cured.</p><p>The alchemists use this oil often but they redistill it and make it into a solid. Then they make whitening and other things. This oil has many other virtues that I have not written but by using it you will discover them. Keep it always near you because the older it is, the more power it gains. When you want to calcine it, do nothing but leave it intact because it calcines better and when it is calcined, it is dark and can be made into fine powder. When you do it this way and keep to the above rules, it will work well for you. Do these tests and you will agree.</p></div2>

If you take less you may not recover the expense because it yields not more than one ounce of oil per pound, or about that. Grind it finely because it works better. Then put it in a clean large pot and fill it and push it in as well as you can but do not break the pot. Put on its cover and lute the cover on the pot so nothing can escape and make it so the seal sticks out about the thickness of a finger. Let it dry well in the sun. Then make an oven of bricks walled up with clay in a corner of the fireplace under the flue of the chimney and do it in the way that you see here. Fit your pot in the middle and close up around it with bricks that are vented only by one little hole behind. Make a fire of dry wood underneath and burn it very slowly for one whole day, that is 24 hours and let it cool. Then open the oven and draw out your pot. Be careful, before you break the pot in order to remove the vitriol, to have first prepared a large bronze mortar and a sieve covered as it is for spices and a large curved retort as you see. As before, it must be well sealed with lute of wisdom and the neck of the retort hangs out of the oven through an opening. First break the pot which otherwise you would not be able to empty because all has been made into a hard mass of red that looks like powdered brick. Be quick to grind it and sieve it and put it in the retort. This is done so that it takes up little air because it is affected greatly by air so that it does not render the oil sufficiently and if the powder was coarsely sifted it renders less oil. You are warned about all these things. When you have put all this powder in the retort, place it in the oven as you see, so it lies along the length of the oven. The bricks that are used underneath are unbaked and are one finger apart, one from the other, and all the way around it is walled well with bricks and clay and it has a narrow little opening behind and a small opening in the front. At once put the largest receptacle you can find in respect to the great outburst of vapors that comes suddenly at the end. If it is small it would be broken from this sudden outburst but it works the way I tell you. Make the fire in the middle of the oven and be advised that the fire controls everything. Make the fire very slow and with dry wood. If it is not dry, do not use it and, if possible, it should not be one stick each time but at least 2 if you can put them there. Always stir it up one at a time, continually if you see them touching. Never leave the fire and never let it stop burning and keep it always steady. Be warned about this because it is very important. Never leave the fire to burn by itself and at night one must always watch because it must not lack care for 6 days to make it perfect and good. With all this care it will never show you a sign except on the fifth day the spirits will begin to come forth and to come out into the receptacle with great force......</p><pb n="Page 273 : Folio 107r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_273.jpg" folio="107r" /><note place="inline"><p>[Drawing on page.]</p></note><p>because having closed the opening of the receptacle securely with luted cloth all around, the gases cannot escape. Also it is better if the receptacle is large. Here is an ingenious secret so that the receptacle may not be broken by the great heat when the gases are entering. Devise a way that cold water is always dropping on the receptacle and in this way it or any other receptacle will never crack. Be advised that if you do this dropping of water, in 4 or 5 days you will have oil more quickly. If you do not do this dropping of water, you must wait to the fifth and sixth day and then all the gases will come at once. It is a frightening thing to see such dark smoke fill up all the receptacle which then condenses below and soon is reduced to oil. This oil is blackish in color or dark tan and take this, with the aid of God and with speed and dexterity, and extract it from the receptacle and put it in a large glass bottle and secure it because this oil is a very fiery and active spirit. Keep it covered with great care with new or white wax and with 2 or 3 layers of parchment doubled and well tied, because in truth all the spirit may be lost quickly in fumes and be gone.</p><p>At the end I will tell you some of its virtues. But first I want to advise you to make this other oil of ruby-colored vitriol which is red in color, resembling the element of fire. It is made in this way as you will learn. Viz.</p><p>First take some Roman vitriol in the form that you have made before and when you have ground it, put it in a glass vessel and close it well and put it in warm horse manure in the full sun for 15 to 20 days. Then remove it and do as you have done at first, having prepared the retort sealed with lute. Grind the mass and sieve it finely and put it in the retort. So the air does not hurt it, do this quickly and follow the rules above. Then place it in the oven as you see the retort placed above and with as large a receptacle as can be found. Seal the joint so it does not leak.</p><pb n="Page 274 : Folio 107v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_274.jpg" folio="107v" /><p>Make the fire at the beginning very lively and draw off the first water from the top. Be advised that when you see the gases coming, quickly change the receptacle and put under another to receive these gases which are converted into reddish oil. Wrap the joint of the flask so it does not leak, using very good plaster, because in this consists all the importance of your work. Do not let the gases escape, neither by love nor force. Make the fire more temperate and gentle, always continuing it steady with dry wood and you will see these gases coming as was done at first but not as much because they are issuing from water at the top. At first it will be a little less and it will be very reddish red and of the greatest potency, more than all other oils. It is used in medicine and outside of medicine. The philosophers in the works of alchemy call it the 'Green Lion' and it congeals mercury and has the most potent virtues, almost incredible, and in all its actions it is wonderfully potent.<ref id="ref145" n="145" target="en145" type="noteref">145</ref></p><p>Now we will speak of the virtues of the first oil of copper sulfate, first described above.

This has been shown.</p><p>Some say that if the fire is strengthened under the first retort, then the element of fire may come out in the first oil that is extracted, but the fire would need to be lively. I have not tested this and I leave it to you to research more about that. I have done all that I have said to you and have given the rules.

Put everything in a non-vitreous pot, making layer on layer of talc and the powder. Then put on the cover and tie it with iron wire and seal it on very well above and below. When it is dry put it to calcine in the furnace for bricks or the oven for calcining. When it is cold, remove it and grind the talc in a bronze mortar and make fine powder. Then put it on a marble slab and put it in a humid place where animals and wild beasts are not able to go and let it stand until it is converted to water. Then distill this water in a glass retort on a slow fire and the oil will come out. This will make you esteemed because its virtues are not all obvious but a great treasure is found in this oil.

Flake it all finely. I think you know what talc is and if you do not know, I tell you that it is a white stone, shining and lustrous, that appears like silver and is hard and cannot be ground but it cleaves into very fine flakes. Fill a non-vitrious pot with these flakes and tie it with iron wire and seal well around and let it dry in the sun. Then place it in a furnace for bricks or a calcining oven in a secure place where the fire is steady and leave it until the oven is stopped. Then draw it out and you will find your talc is calcined. Grind it in a bronze mortar and powder it finely on marble and let sit on this rock or put it in a large bowl or on a glass plate and put it in a safe humid place where neither animals, nor dust, nor dirt, nor wind can harm it. It should stay hanging over a bowl to collect the oil and it should stay there at least 20 days. Once it begins to yield oil, it will yield all in about one month. If it may not be willing to render the oil, put it in a pointed sack of cloth and assemble it with a glass vessel to collect what comes out. Lower it near the water in a well or at least an arm's length down the well and see that no one removes water there in order not to interfere with the action. Alternatively, make a large hole in the earth in a place where neither air, nor sun, nor moon beats and place this sack so it does not touch any side and cover the opening with some board and let it stay for the space of 20 to 30 days until the oil is given up to you. Know that as it begins to give out the humidity it does not stop until nothing more can come out. With the first that comes out on the marble, you need to do nothing more and you will have oil of talc which will be white and lustrous and appear like silver. Save this to use for your needs because whoever has this oil will not be a poor person. This oil treats all the great lords. The illustrious Duchess of Savoy used no other thing on her body, only this oil, and she was held to have the most beautiful flesh on earth.<ref id="ref147" n="147" target="en147" type="noteref">147</ref></p><p>I do not tell you about solidifying alone because it solidifies and joins at the same time.

Flake it into fine particles and let it stay in olive oil for one whole day. Then touch it to the fire and dry it completely. Grind it in a bronze mortar. Then macerate it on porphyry and make very fine powder. Put it in a glass flask, uncovered, and boil it for 2 hours on a bain marie and then cover it. Distill it in a glass retort, beginning with a slow fire. Augment the fire to lively and it will distill oil. Uusually one puts in some well-washed and clean little stones. In this way you will have oil of talc extracted by distillation. If by chance it does not want to come out, put it in a humid place for some days until it will come out. In this way you will have an oil which does not lack the virtues described above. Use it with great care and hold it dear because I have sold an ampule of a quarter of an ounce of it for one <hi rend="italic">scudo</hi> of gold and this was for an unknown illness.

<div2 id="id240665" type="ss1"><head>Synthetic oil of vitriol that solidifies.</head><p>Take 12 lb. of Roman vitriol and put it in a large pot and cover it well so that gas does not escape and put it in a tub of water so that the water does not enter the pot and with the cover well sealed around so the vitriol does not escape. Boil the tub of water with the pot in it and boil until all the water is reduced in the boiling tub. Then let the pot cool before you touch it. Remove the vitriol from the pot and grind it finely and sift it with a covered sieve so that the air does not affect it and the power is not lost. Be quick to put it in a glass retort, well sealed with strong lute of wisdom and it should be well heated and dried. Put it on good warm ashes and keep it thus for 2 days. Then put it in your oven fitted with its receptacle and with the joint well closed with cloth and luted and well wrapped so the fumes do not escape. Make a moderate fire for 2 days. Do make sure that drops of fresh water continually fall on the receptacle. When the first water comes, it comes with some white fumes and when you have these, you must change the receptacle quickly and seal it well. Then on continuing the fire some other spirits or fumes will soon come out which on going to the bottom are soon converted into oily liquid. You should know that this red oil and this clear water are called permanent because these are permanent things which cure every serious infirmity, as you know from above. Also the oil has in it very great power to stiffen, solidify, precipitate and fix. The true potable gold is made from this material, perfected with purification into the best gold from its ferment of gold. It is made from the water described above. It is true potable gold that cures lepra, ulcer, fistula, epilepsy and prevents an apoplectic stroke.

Then put it in a clean and well-washed bladder and tie it well with strong twine and send it half-way down in the well so that nothing can hurt it and let it stay for at least 15 days or less and all will be converted into oily liquor. It will have properties different from the other in this respect that it does not give off gas and stays more united as a body. Its powers will be more potent. It will give identical effects and has the same virtues as the previous remedy of oil of tartar. Draw it out of the well and let it distill, bringing it forth little by little from the neck of the bladder. You will have a liquor from the oil very perfect for every use. Save it well closed.

Then put everything in a retort as you see in the diagram, very well sealed with lute of wisdom, made with trimmings from cloth or other appropriate things, to the thickness of a finger and let it dry well. Then place it on the little tower base with a grid of iron put in between and closed well from above, leaving there only its opening to let out smoke. Put on its receptacle well-closed with a cloth sealed around the opening so that nothing can escape from any side. Then make up the fire from charcoal or from dry wood, continuing it slowly for the space of half a day. The oil and the wax will come forth into the receptacle and in the retort will stay only the little rocks which are of no value. With your ingenuity, separate the oil from the wax in the receptacle because the oil stays below and the wax above. If you cannot extract it then break the receptacle and remove the oil first from its position and then remove the wax. Save this oil by itself in a double ampule, well-closed and it is done, oil of virgin wax in all its perfection. It has many properties and virtues, especially in fistulas. I have not seen a good miracle from it and for now I do not say more about it to you.</p><p>Note that if you redistill this oil one, 2 or 3 additional times, it is certain that it is reinforced greatly in its power and becomes perfect.

Put it in the retort and place it in the oven with its cover and put the receptacle in place and make a slow fire until you draw off half of the water. Then put it again on the dregs and do this 2 times. The third time make the fire very low until you draw off all the water. Then increase the fire and the oil will come out, but change the receptacle after the water and close the opening very well around so that nothing escapes and the most beautiful yellow oil will come out that appears like streaming gold. It has many virtues, especially against retracted nerves and paralysis and it removes this illness.</p><p type="div3" id="id240869"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It heals every fistula from salt humor, both old and recent.

Boil it very slowly until it reduces more than 2/3. Then remove it from the fire and let it cool. Collect the fat that is on top of the water and this will be the true oil of laurel berries. Save this for your needs for which it has many tested and excellent virtues as here in part you will learn. First this oil is warm in the third, some say in the fourth, but I say in the third degree. It is very powerful in removing the itch both when given alone and with other oils. When the spleen is rubbed repeatedly with this warm oil and with oil of capers, it is cured. Also with oil of lily, of camomile and saffron, this oil is powerful when it is rubbed on the body of a woman for 3 or 4 evenings to cause the period to start. If a man rubs his member and uses it, he will feel an effect out of the ordinary. It is powerful in many cold infirmities and cures marvelously.</p></div2>

The distillate will be made in 12 hours. It will be just like ice when distilled again in the retort. If it is distilled for the third time it will give out water that is clean and pure. Take 3 ounces of dregs of this antimony and put 1 lb. of this water in the retort. When it boils a little it will distill out water the color of gold.

<div2 id="id240949" type="ss1"><pb n="Page 280 : Folio 110v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_280.jpg" folio="110v" /><head>To make the true and perfect oil of antimony.</head><p>This is a rare secret of the fifth essence. God, the creator of heaven and earth, is my witness that now I wish to reveal to you such a secret that has been revealed to very few men on earth and this is one of the greatest that is on earth. This is the way, viz.</p><p>First take antimony and powder it as much as is possible and put it in very strong distilled vinegar. Put it in a vitreous vessel and close it well so that no gases can escape and let it stay thus until you see the vinegar becoming red. Put this vinegar in another vessel, also vitreous, and make sure it stays well covered. Then put more distilled vinegar again on the antimony so that it is well covered as before and let it stay until this vinegar becomes red like the first. Then put the two together and keep it covered so that its power does not escape and again put other vinegar onto the previous antimony. Continue in this way until the vinegar takes on all the red color. Keep on in this way and always cover both so that the odor does not go away. When the antimony does not dye more red, do not put on more but let the vessel with the antimony in it stay in a place that is warm all the time so the red color comes out of the base. Then take all this red vinegar that you have nursed from the base of antimony and distill it in a glass still with its cover and its receptacle with a slow fire. First will come forth the vinegar converted into water as it was at first. Then you will see a stupendous miracle that will come miraculously from this blessed antimony. Red drops will fall like blood which you will collect in a suitable glass vessel and seal it well. In this way you will have the Quintessence and know that you will have such a thing that all the treasure of the world is not its equal. I see this as such a special miracle that its sweetness compares with sugar or honey. I tell you most certainly that human intellect is not able to comprehend, nor understand, nor believe the value of the stupendous power of this thing. I tell you especially that Aristotle in his book of secrets called this his lead although he did not mention the name of antimony. Believe me that most certainly never, never did nature make such a secret as great as this. Note well that I tell you every man has been worn out and troubled through wishing to find this Quintessence of antimony. No one in this world has the littlest knowledge to know how to make it in the way I have taught you. I tell you that this secret is above all secrets. I am certain that a thousand, thousand periods of time would not be sufficient to tell half of the secrets which are in this blessed Quintessence that miraculously removes every sore and heals it. Its virtue is incomprehensible and miraculous when it is made in the above way.</p><p>Note then that when the Quintessence is made you need to put it in an amphora, well closed, and put it in manure underground for 4 days so that it stays warm and is putrefied. Remove it and it will be made and then use it. Never will you find that this is the lead of the philosophers which is said to be the fifth essence. Briefly, know that it may give color to everything except only mercury. Praise God for such a secret. I do not tell you of its virtues but I advise you that if you put in vinegar distilled from white lead and let it boil for 2 hours, the vinegar will be consumed and the white lead remains thick as oil. This is called oil of lead. This is enough for you.<ref id="ref150" n="150" target="en150" type="noteref">150</ref></p></div2>

Put it in a pot that is well sealed and put on it enough distilled vinegar to cover it to a depth of 2 fingers and put on its cover with the receptacle below and bind well around the joint and let it stay on the warm ashes putrefying for at least 2 days in a row. Then build up the fire brightly until all this vinegar that you have put on rises out. It will come out all yellow and fiery. Do this process 3 or 4 times, that is remove the antimony from the pot and make powder again and do as you did the first time, until the vinegar that distills out has no more color but is almost white as when you put it in. Little by little you will see that the vessel becomes dry when it is covered so it does not give off fumes. Then the base of antimony is no good any more. Take the colored vinegar and put it in a large vitreous pot and let it evaporate. What stays at the bottom is the good quality and you should make this imbibe oil of tartar 3 or 4 times. Then put this material on a marble slab and put it in a humid place where it will not be disturbed by anything and let the oil come out and collect this in a receiving bottle, well closed, and so will be made the true oil of antimony.<ref id="ref151" n="151" target="en151" type="noteref">151</ref></p><p type="div3" id="id241092"> <hi rend="bold">Another, a similar oil of antimony made by a fantastic method.

Put in enough strong vinegar so that it is covered one or 2 fingers deep and let it stay covered in a warm place to infuse for 24 hours or more, as you wish. Then put on as a cover another crucible like the first directly above in the opening, as you see, and make a round opening in the bottom and put on this crucible a retort that has a hole in the bottom that enters into that of the crucible, as you see, and seal all the crucible and the retort in the way that all is closed as one thing. Place the first crucible with the material in it into a basin made of copper or clay that has an opening at the bottom so the crucible can be placed almost in the center of the basin. Then fill the basin with fine ashes and from below or around the basin, put some bricks fixed together with clay. Make the fire there and have all the joints well closed so they do not leak. First make the fire very low, then increase it little by little until it reaches the melting point and the antimony begins to melt and continue the fire until no more oil distills. Thus is made oil of antimony perfect and valuable because it must distill at a height, as you see, and this is the best. Save it well and carefully for this oil is very beautiful and of great virtue.</p></div2>

You will be able to extract oil from every wood that is gummy and dry in this way by making the fire from above as you see. Put the retort in a cauldron or a pot which has an opening at the bottom so that the neck of the retort can pass through and join with the receptacle below, as you see. When the retort is in the pot with the bottom upward, so it seems to come out of the pot, and join it with the recipient below as you see. Fill the pot with finely sieved ashes. Then place the recipient below, as you see, and put in this a fine straw or pig bristle to give an exit when the vapor begins to come, for it might crack the receptacle. Wrap the joint well so it will not let out gas from any side and make the fire from above, as you see. Then make a hole in the earth and put in first the receptacle, then the pot with the retort fitted in it and make the fire as usual in the earth with dry wood or charcoal, very slowly so the retort does not crack. Seal the receptacle so that it does not break easily. As it begins to distill, remove the straw so that a little gas escapes which helps keep the receptacle from exploding. In this way you can distill everything which may be difficult to distill by other methods. Through this descending distillation, everything will come out for you.</p><p>With this method you will be able to extract oil from juniper wood and cypress wood and from lignum vitae, that is guaiac wood, to bathe the gummas of syphilis.

Put a grid between the pots so the wood does not fall into the lower pot. Both pots should be open so the fumes from them are able to go out. They should be placed within the fire box so the charcoal fire extends around the upper pot in the fire box.

After you catch them, save them in a glass vessel with bran and basil leaves. They should be caught and this oil should be made under the sign of the lion, if possible, because at that time they are in the best condition. When you have caught them do not hold them for more than 5 or 6 days. Put the oil to boil in a glass vessel on the bain marie and when it boils, put in the scorpions, but first stir them up with a little stick to incite them so they will give out their venom. At once throw them in the boiling oil and boil them at least 15 hours or more in the bath. The vessel where they are boiling should be well covered and closed so that nothing escapes. Then strain the oil and press the scorpions in the press and extract all the substance that you can and put it with the oil and throw away the dregs. Then take a large flask not made of thick glass and put them in the strained oil but do not fill the flask so that it cracks from the weight. For each pound of this oil take 1 ounce each of theriac, mithridatum, clay from Lemnos and fine rhubarb, with everything in powder, and ½ ounce each of hepatic aloe, lavender and saffron and add 1 dram of troches from Tyre. If you do not have this and cannot get it, use troches from Madras. All of the above things should be made into fine powder separately, if they can be powdered. Then put them in the flask and cover it well and leave it in the sun for 40 days, day and night. Every day shake it well upside down, carefully. To have this oil of great value very secure, place it in a vessel that holds it, so if it fell and the flask was broken, the oil would not be lost. Then when it is made, put it in a safe place so when the need arises, from which God save us, you will always have it to use for you and for others. This oil is very good and effective against every kind of venom and it is powerful against poisons and envenomed sores.

Continue this for an entire day of 24 hours, doing this 6 times in 6 hours, and then 12 times in 12 hours and do this for one more day. Also you ought to rub one who might go to eat in a suspected place.

Do this until the pain has gone. But first blood may be drawn as is the custom for infections.</p><p>Also for one who may have to be with infected persons. First he is rubbed as above, but it is enough to do it 24 times in 24 hours.

Another, similar oil follows.</p><p type="div3" id="id241335"> <hi rend="bold">Oil similar to that above, tested in the time of our lord Pope Paul III on 2 prisoners in the tower of Savella by Monsignor Diomede the Neapolitan who was responsible for not cutting off their heads instead. This is the way to make this oil. Viz.<ref id="ref154" n="154" target="en154" type="noteref">154</ref></hi> Take 2 lb. of the oldest olive oil that you can find and put in this oil 1 lb. of live scorpions, more or less according to what you want to make. One lb. of oil takes ½ lb. of live scorpions. Bring this oil to a boil on a bain marie in a vessel that has a long neck, at least 2 or 3 hands in length and seal it and boil it on a slow fire. Put the scorpions in a glass vessel and poke them with a little stick so their poison ejects out. Then put them in the oil and boil them very well until the scorpions are well cooked. Remove it from the fire and let it cool. Remove the scorpions and grind them in a mortar. Return them to the oil in the vessel and again on the bain marie and boil them again for an hour or more. Let it cool and strain the oil through clean muslin, pressing the solids well and extract as much as you can and put it in the oil. Then put it in a glass vessel, close it well and put it in the sun in the clear sky for 40 days in a row and it will be made. Do not alter the rules given above for making it in a month of great heat, because the heat reinforces the power in the oil and gives it the same virtues that the first has. Also when you want to use it, follow the method and rules given above, especially when the person may have been poisoned. The first thing is to rub around the heart that is the principle problem 6 times in 6 hours. Do this on the first day. On the second day do it 12 times in12 hours.

You should know that to save yourself, you should stay in repose as much as you can and keep your body warm. Your diet should be white bread, well-aged and well-cooked. It would be better to have twice baked breads with some ground anise and a little sugar in them. Meat should be roasted and well-cooked and light and tender such as very young chickens or saddle of young goats and soft fresh eggs. Everything should be well cooked and easy to digest. Chew the food well and drink some of the second water with every meal. If by chance this is not possible to do, take a little white wine, light in nature and not sour. Do not eat salty food, nor vegetables, nor fruits, nor sour things, nor soup, nor pork meat, nor young beef, nor fish of any kind except pickerel on the grill if only a little is taken at a time. When the meat is cooked, keep it soft with veal fat and with no other fat. Eat twice a day and no more. Drink wine only in this way, diluted a little with the second water, and it will help you better. When you have finished drinking the first boiling, use the second, the third and the fourth, more or less according to how rapidly it is consumed. Every 10 days is enough for each time, because following this diet cures this infirmity perfectly. It is not effective in less than 40 days or sooner, more or less, because never or seldom is one completely cured because this illness is healed with great effort. Who does it willingly and for a long time, keeping himself well, I say that he will be cured. Be advised in this, that in every 8 to 9 days you will be feeling better. First the pain of the temples stops, then the aches, then you will begin to get out of bed, to walk a little in the room, then to see the outside. Do not worry but have companionship.

I have said rarely, because I have seen some that have the oldest illness and the most acute pain and they have been freed and remain healthy. Anyone who has been cured of the French sickness, if by chance he has another illness, will be always worse than he would have been if he had not had the French sickness. If a man is wounded who was freed of the French sickness and recently was cured, yet if a finger is cut by cutting bread that usually would be cured in 24 hours, it is not cured in 40 days.

They are wanted for those who have the French sickness that is not recent and who are liverish, yellow and dropsical and with other problems that the person may have inside. Use all these items for your cure. Viz.</hi> Take 1 ounce each of colocynth and round birthwort, 2 ounces each of cloves, nutmeg, long pepper, ginger and grains of paradise, 2 scruples each of musk and amber, 6 ounces of fine sugar and 3 lb. of malvasia or good wine. Break up all these things coarsely and put them in a little linen sack that is clean and pure. Take a clean little pot or other suitable vessel and put in the malvasia and 2 or 3 lb. of cistern water. Then put in the sack which should be suspended in the middle so that it does not touch the bottom or even the sides of the pot. Make it boil very slowly with a low fire until it reduces 1/3. Then put in the sugar and after it has reached 2 or 3 boilings, remove it from the fire and it will be made, the beverage which is worthy and high class. When it is cool, strain it carefully. Save it in a glass flask, pressing the sack well and save it in a secure place that is cool because the longer it has been made, the better it is and it does not spoil. See that the patient takes it every morning as the usual syrup, at least 6 ounces, if he has the kind of sickness that requires following the rule of what ought to be taken. Then he should wait at least 4 or 5 hours before eating and he should eat only good food, delicate and light, and this without exception. He should not eat things that are harmful, nor things sour, nor salty and in all things he should be temperate.</p><pb n="Page 296 : Folio 118v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_296.jpg" folio="118v" /><p>If the sick person finds that he feels better, he should continue to take this syrup at least for 20 to 30 days in a row. When you have taken a dose you should stay in bed, warm, at least nearly until lunch. Then after eating, according to the infirmity that you have, you can go out of the house to do something easy and keep well covered, especially the head, and do not stay a long time in the air because this syrup is not a cure for everything. That is, you should be careful except in the morning and act according to how you feel. You should be governed by the seriousness of the sickness that you have and if the legs can hold up to walk.</p><p>Note that if the patient has the serious French sickness with great pain and may have taken 4 or 6 or 10 doses of the above syrup, one may want to anoint from the waist downward to under the soles of the feet for the space of 3 mornings and not more, that is one after the other. He should stand before a good fire and then be rubbed with the ointment very warm and then be put in a good bed, covered with a blanket. But note that if the sickness comes suddenly into the mouth, that is in the throat, you should treat him at once with this gargle, giving it repeatedly for gargling. In this way he will be helped quickly to remove the trouble in the throat.</p><p type="div3" id="id243232"> <hi rend="bold">This is the lotion with which the patient is rubbed. First take these things. Viz.</hi> Take 2 ounces each of oil of camomile, rose oil and turpentine, ½ ounce of yellow litharge, 2 drams of mastic, 1 ounce each of white lead and clean wax, quicksilver mortified with a grain of salt and 1 ounce of vinegar, 1 scruple of rancid butter and 2 egg yolks. Put all these things in a pot and put in first the oil, the wax, the turpentine and the butter. Put the pot on a slow fire to melt and incorporate these things, mixing it with a rod. Then remove the pot from the fire and put therein the other things that have been pulverized finely. When it is nearly cold, put in the quicksilver, first mortified well with the vinegar and salt in a reed tube in a bowl. Also put in the egg yolks. Stir well with your rod for a little bit so everything is incorporated together and all is well cooled because the mercury has difficulty being incorporated. It tends to separate out, so do not lack being careful. Also the lotion becomes more fine and perfect and has greater power. You should rub the patient with the French sickness with this oil or unguent as described above, before a good fire. Begin from the waist and always go downward nearly to the soles of the feet. Do this for 3 mornings in a row as is said before, and then the patient should stay in bed very warm. Because the sickness may move immediately to the throat, first prepare the gargle. For a half hour before you do the rubbing, the patient should take in the mouth a little rock alum the size of half a chestnut and always roll it around in the mouth and then spit it out and begin to gargle freely. When you wish to begin to rub, light a good fire and remove the clothing and rub gently downward. As the sickness is felt to come in the throat, at once remove the alum that was in the mouth and begin the gargle with the decoction written below.

This will continue for a day and a half. Keep on with gargling. It will not prevent the illness that comes in the mouth but enables one to spit it out. At the end of the three days in which you do the anointing, the patient stays thus for 2 or 3 days without using anything else, neither syrup nor beverage, but keep him resting with delicate food for sustenance according to its availability.</p><p>Then begin to use the above-described syrups. As much is taken until the sickness is much improved and the patient's great suffering has lightened. At this time the patient cannot know if he has recovered. It is good if he feels somewhat improved from the gravity of the sickness, but if not at present, then it may be 'yes' in a few days. Now the medicine causes a sign of great benefit to the patient. The lost appetite returns and he eats with eagerness and great appetite. So nature is nourished and the patient becomes better although not as before. He should not risk acting in a disorderly way in eating and in other things and should keep to the orders and rules given above and, with the aid of God, soon he will be cured because this is the best treatment that is in the world.</p><p>Note that these remedies are useful in every serious infirmity. This beverage is used for gargling more or less according to its effectiveness and how the patient feels. Also he can take a syrup every other day according too how it seems to the master apothecary who is treating him. This cannot well be put in writing because the master apothecary is the one who knows how serious the sickness is. You should know that it is certain that the gargle will bring you honor above all other things. Every time it is used, always mix the container well so that the patient receives some of the substance that stays at the bottom. Use it when there is any illness in the throat. It is very appropriate for all sicknesses of the throat.</p><head>This is the water for gargling that is taken by mouth when one is being rubbed for the French sickness and also is good in other illnesses of the throat.</head><p>Take 4 ounces each of rose honey, water of endive, plantain, fumitory and rose water.

Put them together in a container for using when needed as described above, from which God keep us.</p><p>Note, Master Apothecary, how you want to effect a cure. First, get the advice of the physician as to whether to take blood or not. Then follow your rules for giving the first 3 syrups and the medicine described above. Then give the usual syrups as above and when you have given 4 or 5 you will be able to begin to do the rubbing, slowly by the fire as described, and with that the alum in the mouth and as soon as the burning is felt, the patient should spit it out and begin to gargle with the above water. Be careful about everything and do not doubt that you will cure him through the aid of God. The patient should watch how he lives, as is said above, and keep from everything adverse and he will be cured. This is a worthy remedy for you.

You will need a tub or a vat, either large or small, to be able to hold half of the defoliated roses, more or less according to your opinion and depending on the amount that you wish to make. Take the clean water and put it on the fire and when it wants to start boiling, do not let it boil but pour it boiling on the roses and you will have a mixture formed into a slab. Turn the roses upside down for a bit until they all become blanched white. Then cover the tub or vat or conch that should be in an appropriate cauldron wrapped with wool or linen to keep it warm so that the warmth keeps all the virtue or effectiveness in the water. Do this again for the second and third morning and this is enough. If you want to do it the fourth time, you can do it without adding more roses and it will be more odoriferous and more powerful. Draw out the roses that are soft and press them as firmly as you can with your hands and save these to make odorous water. Reheat this soft mixture little by little, that is the infusion, and do not add any more water than the first. You should put in all 3 infusions because it increases the strength. Always reheat well as you did at first and throw on fresh and clean roses. In this way you will have made the infusion to use to make rose honey.</p><p>Then take 60 lb. of the clear infusion without the roses and 20 or 25 lb. of honey. The correct measure always is 1/3 part of honey and in this way you will make it perfect and effective. It is true that if you put in more honey, up to 30 or 35 lb. it makes a bigger amount and it will be more to your profit but it will not have then all the medicinal properties. To be perfect it needs to have that much of the rose infusion. When you have mixed in the honey, put the cauldron on the fire and heat it very well and stir with your ladle so it incorporates well together. When it is very warm, skim it well. Then you should have prepared your pointed bags, at least 3 or 4 or 6 or more, partly of linen and partly of wool and they should be fastened as you see above. Put therein some of this prepared broth and strain it very slowly until it comes out clear. Put it in again several times so it comes out in clear drops, beautiful and clean and looks like a ruby.

By putting it repeatedly through the sacks, the drops will come out clear and beautiful. Save the foam that you remove when it is on the fire. Do not throw it away because in the bottom resides much that is also good. Do not let it boil because it would thicken and not strain easily. If it is difficult to strain because of its thickness, reheat it again. It needs to be warm to filter easily. Be warned that bees and wasps will be after it actively. Watch that you keep it in a safe place. Then put it again in your clean cauldron and make the fire underneath so that it boils very slowly. Stir well with your ladle so that none sticks to the bottom and takes on the odor of smoke that would not be good. It will develop much foam and lift that away very carefully and put it in a sack and so it strains by itself. Let it boil until it is well cooked but not burned and let it boil slowly. Do this test on a card. Let 2 or 3 drops fall and if they stay well joined together and firm and do not slide when the card is tilted, then it is cooked. At once remove it from the fire and save it warm in a vitreous pottery vessel so that it does not take on the odor of copper. In this way you will have made your rose honey, good and perfect in every way for beauty and quality.</p><p>Note that if you were to make a furnace so you could wall in the cauldron with clay so the flames were not able to get in, you would be more certain that you would not take in the smoke or other bad odors.

Then put in some sugar from Saint Thomas or Madeira that is red. The redder it is the more laxative it is and it works better. First clean it in this way.

In this way you will have cleaned the sugar.<ref id="ref167" n="167" target="en167" type="noteref">167</ref></p><p>Note that this is the correct measure. Take 30 lb. of the infusion and 20 lb. of the red sugar clarified with egg white as described above. Put everything together in the clean cauldron. Put it on the fire and heat it well until it wants to boil but do not let it boil. Then strain it in the sack described above and make it strain very slowly. Strain it several times until at last the filtrate comes out clear, lustrous, beautiful and ruby-colored. If it is too cold to come out, you can reheat it. When it is warm it strains easily because it does not have so much viscosity. Do not touch the sack or it may come out turbid. In this way you will make the filtrate clear and beautiful. Then put it in a clean cauldron to cook on the fire. Using dry wood, make it boil slowly and stir repeatedly for good results. Let it boil until it reduces 1/3 or more. Test it by putting 2 or 3 drops on a card and if this stays firm and does not spread out on the card, it is made or you can put a little of the old paragon with the new. If it is not now as lustrous and ruby-colored, that is not important while it is cooking because as it becomes cold, it will take on color again.</p><p>Note that if one wants to make a good laxative, put in 2 drams of purging bindweed and tie it in a cloth and make a little button and tie it with a thread of yarn. Boil it in and when it is cooked, pull it out and throw it away. It is not useful any more. Likewise, you can boil in the preparation 1 handful of the herb hedge hyssop which grows in swampy meadows and has a leaf like hyssop and some call it our senna. Boil it in a little sack and when it is cooked, remove it and throw it away as it is of no more good. In this you will have made a red sugar laxative, the best and perfect. Remove it at once when it is cooked and put it in a good vitreous, clay vessel....</p></div2>

When you need to make the body go, this has no equal. The dose is 3 ½ ounces up to 4, but first experiment to see if 3 works or not with that made all of dew. Then boil in the scammony or the herb hedge hyssop and these 3 things make it very laxative. Dilute it with 2 ounces of mallow water and give it in the morning at dawn somewhat tepid and afterward one should repose for ½ hour although this is not a medicine for which repose is necessary. Everyone can take it with confidence.</p><p>Note that this laxative is useful in purging every choler and also in any tertian fever and joint pain caused by warm matter. It removes all the bad warm and feverish humors from which comes its benefit in the feverish and malign erysipelas. In the burning black fever, Persian anthrax, it is given together with <hi rend="italic">diacatholicon</hi> and it clears out the remnants of the humors. Then the patients begin to be better and they trust in the medicine. They will not use it if they do not think it is helping. When you have given this medicine, in one hour give a bowl of chicken or mutton broth to drink with one ounce of red sugar.<ref id="ref168" n="168" target="en168" type="noteref">168</ref></p><p type="div3" id="id244382"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> Some make it in this way. They take 9 lb. of cistern water and 9 lb. of roses, as above, and they make it in the way described above in 9 or 10 mornings. Then they do not put in the dew, but put in the scammony or the herb hedge hyssop. It is true that it works, but not as well as the dew does. It has been shown many times that the dew is more gentle and works very wonderfully. Keep to the rule given above and you will never fail and you will always get honor for it.</p><p>Note that when you want to refresh the laxative syrup, take 2 flasks of dew, one collected on burnet saxifrage, the other collected on cabbage.

Break it up with the hand so that it dissolves in the pot. Then put the pot on the fire and heat it slowly, I say very slowly. When it begins to swell, do not ever touch the foam but leave it alone. Do not break it or it may become turbid. To help it clear up while it is swelling, put in a little honey or 2 ounces of water from distilled white vinegar or sprinkle on the juice of one lemon or bitter orange or 4 seeds of sour grapes or as much burnt rock alum as a fava bean or less. Let the foam rise little by little and when you see that it is all swollen and about to begin to boil, do not for anything let it boil but at once remove it from the fire and pour it into 2 pointed sacks, made of wool and of felt, one in the other. Pour it very slowly so the foam does not go in but all remains in the pot. Let it filter so it comes out clear and beautiful. If it does not seem clear and lustrous to you, put it very slowly through another sack that is thicker and it will filter out more clear....</p></div2>

If by bad luck, it does not want to come out, do one more clarification only, but do not put in any sour things as you have done before because you may make it come out cloudy and then it could be cleared only with great effort and trouble. So you will have the filtrate clear and lustrous. Clean the pot well so it shines and put it again in the pot and reboil very slowly with a low, clear fire, because with boiling too furiously it wll become turbid. When it has boiled a half hour do the test on the card or on your fingernail to see if the drop is firm or not. If the drop is firm, it is cooked. Then pour in 2 or 3 ounces of good rose water or otherwise water of violet flowers. This is known as rose julep or violet julep. Then remove it from the fire and pour it into a clay basin, clean and polished and without odor, until it is cold. Then put it in your glass ampules, covered, and keep it in a cool place so it does not spoil. When it begins to ferment it is then neither so delicate nor good. It will last in the summertime for a month if it is well cooked. When the julep is made do not let it cook too long and then this julep is a clear yellow color, beautiful to see.</p><p>Note that if you make the julep of white sugar, you should do the clearing described above and not put in anything except that sugar and pure water. When it is finally cooked, put in your rose water or water of fresh violets. In this way you can make a good and effective julep from all the different sugars.</p><p>This julep is very powerful in cooling and alleviating the great distress of burning heat and fever if you drink it with boiled water or barley water or with fresh water. It alleviates the fierce heat of the liver and is good in many other conditions in medicine in addition to this.</p><head>Rose sugar, effective and beautiful, with some of its uses.</head><p>Take the buds of red roses before they are completely open and cut away all that white underneath with a scissors so they are clean. Use 4 ounces of these to 1 lb. of sugar. Cut them finely and grind very minutely. Then take this pound of white sugar and purify it as you have done for the julep with an egg white and one pound or more of well water and convert the white all into foam. Then put in the water and break up the sugar with your hand and put it on the fire. When it starts to swell, do not put in anything. Let it rise well and as you see that it wants to begin to boil, remove it at once from the fire. Filter it in 2 pointed sacks and filter it well so it comes out clean. Then put it again in the pot that has been well-washed and clean and put it on the fire to cook. You will know when it is well cooked by seeing the sign. Then put in your roses that are well ground and make it boil for a good piece, always stirring with your ladle, around and up and down, so that everything is well incorporated. Remove it from the fire as it has been made and put it warm in your bottles and cover it until it is cold and put it ...</p><pb n="Page 306 : Folio 123v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_306.jpg" folio="123v" /><p>in the sun for 10 to 15 days. When it is very cold, stir very well so that it is mixed together and you will have a rose sugar, good, excellent and perfect, odorous and very pleasing. If you wish to make it a beautiful red, take a little red sandalwood and soak it in water until that is very red. When you have filtered the sugar, tint it with this water to the color that you want. Then it is time to put in your roses and when it is cooked it will be a beautiful red, odoriferous as the paragon, the Neopolitan red sugar that is made red in this way.</p><p>Note that if you want to make rose sugar from pink roses, it is not so beautiful to see but is as good and has the same virtues as this above and also keeps the laxative effect if you will make it in this way. Take some pink roses gathered with the dew or condensation on them. Defoliate them and do not cut away anything and be sure they are clean. Then cut them finely and grind very small. Take some red sugar, a little more than usual, and purify it with egg white as you have done above. Put therein a pound of roses with 3 ½ pounds of sugar, close to 4, and when the sugar is well cooked, put in the ground roses and boil it for a half hour or more. Remove the pot from the fire and while it is still warm, put it in a bottle and put it in the sun for 8 to 10 days. Stir up the bottle each day until it will not bubble up any more and it will keep well. It has the same properties and virtues as the rose sugar but it is more laxative. If you take a half ounce in the evening when you go to sleep and afterward drink 3 ounces of endive water, in the morning you will go from the body at least 2 or 3 times without any trouble. It has been tested.</p><p type="div3" id="id244569"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> If you wish to make fresh rose sugar without cooking, do it in this way. Take the rose and if it is red, cut away the white completely because this is constipating and bitter. If you use the pink, take them entire but clean of every other thing. Cut them well and grind them finely, I say well ground because if they are not well ground, it remains between the teeth or under them. This rose grinds badly and that makes it feel bad, but grind them well and the result is refined. Then put in the sugar, weighed and measured as above. Grind everything together so that it is well mixed. Then when you have incorporated and ground it well, strain it and put it in your clean bottles or pots, covered with parchment, and make several openings with the point of a knife and put it in the warm sun for at least 20 to 30 days and mix it top to bottom with the ladle or stirring rod so that it will not boil or swell and go out of the bottle. This is the way to make it uncooked, good and perfect like that above except that it holds more of the odor of the rose and comforts the mind more through its strong odor which is much more pleasing because it is not cooked. This has been tested many, many times.</p></div2>

Take 4 ounces of it and 1 lb. of sugar, always 1 part to 3 parts, and grind them well together. This is intended for crushed white sugar but if you put in red sugar, always put in a little more which is better in every way and it keeps the electuaries always soft and rich. Then put it in your bottle, covered with parchment, and make several openings with the point of a knife and put it in the sun for several days. Each day stir it with your stirring rod. Especially in the water lily electuary, do not fill up the bottle because it swells terribly and stir it often so that it does not overflow the bottle.

In addition, mixed with fennel water, it is very active against prolonged fevers caused by excessive phlegm. It also has other virtues. Test it and you will see.</p><head>The way simple syrups are made, with some of their virtues.</head><p>Take the kinds of herbs from which you wish to make syrups, such as endive, chicory, sorrel, fumitory, mint, lavender, violet, rose and the 2 roots. When you make the juice of all these herbs, be sure they are fresh, clean and well washed and dry and that they do not have dew on them. First cut each one by itself into fine pieces. Then grind them well and put them in a canvas sack and press them well under the press to extract the juice. Then put it in a pot or in a little cauldron that is clean and polished. Do this work quickly because the juice cannot sit once made and spoils very quickly. Therefore put it at once on the fire to cleanse it. Make the fire low until the foam comes to a head and let it boil very slowly for half an hour. Then strain it finely. In this way make the juices of all the above herbs. Also all others are made in this way except for some flowers and those herbs that do not have juice but are dry. You can save these juices separately and put them in flasks or carafes. Fill them and put on a little olive oil and that preserves them by keeping out the air which makes them spoil so they are not good. Keep them in a cool place, covered so they are not spoiled.</p><p>First we speak of the rose syrup that you have made. Take some of the infusion that you have made for the sugar laxative which is good and advantageous to use to make rose syrup.</p><p>Violet syrup is made in this way. Take 4 or 5 lb. of cistern water and one pound of clean violets without pedicels. I recommend the ones the color of peacock blue. Heat the water so that it is ready to boil but does not boil and put therein the violets and stir them well up and down and cover the vessel well and leave it in a warm place for 24 hours. The next morning, remove the violets and press them well in the press. Then reheat the infusion as you did at first and put in more fresh flowers as you did before. Do it in this way 4 or 5 times, cleansing them on the fire and filtering it and the violet syrup will be made.</p><p>Syrup of lavender. Take the pure flowers, cut them and grind them well and cover them with water because otherwise you will not extract juice. Cleanse them in the fire and then extract from them and it will be made. Preserve it like the others.</p><p>Syrup of 2 roots is not preserved because it does not last more than a month. Take roots of fennel and the roots of parsley. Cut them and boil them with water until it is reduced a third. Strain this and press it well and it will be made, syrup of 2 roots.</p><p>Syrup of mint, fumitory, endive, chicory and sorrel.

Then put it on a low fire until the foam rises to a head and when it begins to want to boil, remove it from the fire and strain it in the pointed sacks described above. When it is all strained, put it again on the fire in the pot that has been cleaned. When it wants to boil, remove it from the fire and strain it one more time so it will be very clear and lustrous like its essence. Then put it again in the pot which should be well scrubbed and clean. Put it on the fire and boil it very slowly and remove the foam with the bottom of the spoon. Let this boil until it reduces at least 2/3 of the juice or make the test with the card to see if the drop is firm or not. Let it cook well because if it does not simmer and you keep it for a long time, with aging the sugar becomes candied which is not effective and good. Then when the syrup is cooked, put it in vitreous bottles to keep. You should know that to make the syrup, each pound of juice of the infusion needs a half pound of sugar and not less. Follow the rules in the way described above and all will come out well for you.</p><p>These are some of the virtues. First of the violet syrup.

The first way is through odors, that is when the odor of something malignant immediately occupies the principal members, that is the heart, the brain and the liver. These are the signs of pestilence, that is swelling of the glands in the emuntories of the principal members. When the heart is harmed the sign appears in the armpit. When the brain is harmed, the sign appears in the ears. When the liver is harmed, it appears in the right rib. When the spleen is harmed, it is in the left inguinal region. In addition some carbuncles come in other parts of the body and these occur when there is greater putrefaction and scorching of the humors in the body. When nature is strained too much to draw them out, carbuncles appear in the principal members. The chest shows the worst effect and this is because it is a sign that the humors are burnt up and putrefied around the region of the heart.<ref id="ref173" n="173" target="en173" type="noteref">173</ref></p><p>The second way is by suffocation of the natural warmth, caused by humidity and watery putrefaction. Certainly we see such humidity gathered in our body and especially in the head through which swellings are generated in the throat. This illness is called quinsy from which some die. Sometimes heavy catarrh accumulates from which humans may quickly suffocate. Sometimes humidity causes deafness and damage in the head with accumulation of fluid in the eyes and great dullness, paralysis and epilepsy.</p><p>The third cause is because worms are generated from bad humors through putrefaction. They may come to the upper parts of the body and make painful lesions until they make the body come into syncope from which it may not recover. If the condition is not helped, the person may soon die from the pain and also from the toxic fumes arising from the bad humors that break up and destroy the vital spirits.</p></div2>

At once remove it and empty it into a basin of vitreous pottery and make it pass, that is drip, through a piece of felt that is well stretched and cleaned. Put it in the pot on a trivet and boil it until the material stays congealed at the bottom. Then remove it from the fire and keep it until the next day to collect as much as you can. Remove it and grind it a little at a time in the mortar and put it in a bladder so that is half full or a little more, and if needed it can be put in 2 or 3 bladders. Tie them well so it cannot be spilled and put it to soften over water. At the end of 2 days it will be made. Then put it in an ampule and save it for your needs.

But do not eat cabbages of any sort because they generate poisons in the stomach, nor cheese nor anything cooked with it. So say Galen and Hippocrates in 64 aphorisms in the fifth particular. It is a very bad thing to give milk to the feverish or to those who are suffering pain. On the day that blood is drawn, one must not sleep because through sleep a kind of little fever arises that makes the person develop syncope, that is depression of the heart or dimness of vision in such a way that in some it causes distress, that is swooning.</p><p>This is the value of phlebotomy, that is of withdrawing blood. You should know that this reduction of blood has all these uses.

That is, choler is warm and dry, phlegm is cold and humid, blood is warm and humid, melancholia is cold and dry. Also the year is divided in 4 parts, that is, spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring is [warm] and humid like the blood, summer is warm and dry like choler, autumn is cold and dry like melancholia, winter is cold and humid like phlegm.<ref id="ref175" n="175" target="en175" type="noteref">175</ref></p><p>According to philosophy, spring begins on February 22 and ends on March 24.

Spring has 92 days, summer 91 days, autumn 92 days and winter 90 days. You should know that fire, summer and choler are of one and the same consitution. Water, phlegm and winter are of one constitution. Air, blood and spring are of one and the same constitution. Autumn, earth and melancholia are of the same constitution. Each of these observations, in truth, confirms the other, for the flesh and bone resemble the earth, the blood resembles water, the respiration the air, and heat the fire.</p></div2>

<div2 id="id245858" type="ss1"><head>Part of knowledge about the urine.</head><p type="div3" id="id245865"> <hi rend="bold">How to know the urine.</hi> First, know that the 2 things that give color to the urine are the natural warmth of the body and the coldness and the 2 things that give texture to the urine are the humidity of the body and the dryness or the heat. The heat gives it the white color and the humidity gives it thickness, that is the turbidity. The dryness gives it clarity and makes it clear. One should examine the urine well outside and in the urinal.</p><p>First, you should know well that if the urine is red and very vermillion and thick and not clear, this signifies that the blood is too abundant. If it is vermillion and clear or yellow, it signifies that there is too much heat. If it is white and thick and dark in color and more thick than very clear, it signifies that there is too much phlegm. If it is white and clear and transparent, that signifies that there is too much melancholia. If it is brown and clear, that is transparent, that signifies that the blood is overheated through too much heat and there is great debility. If it is green and transparent, that signifies that there is very great debility of spirit so the blood appears polluted.</p><p type="div3" id="id245899"> <hi rend="bold">Another way to know if any infirmity might be cured or not.</hi> Take the urine of the sick person and put on it a little milk from a woman. Add it very gently and if the milk goes to the bottom, the sick one will die. If the milk stays on top, he will be cured. This is a useful secret.</p><p type="div3" id="id245914"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> Rub the soles of the feet with a little lard and then give the lard to a dog or a mastiff to eat. If he eats it willingly, soon the sick person will be cured. If the dog does not eat it at once, consider the person's cure doubtful. Try this and you will see the proof of it.</p></div2>

First make a bandage with egg white and salt and soak a stupe in it and put it on the wound. If the blood continues to flow from the wound, put on another bandage after adding a little finely-ground soot. Wrap it well and let it stay on not less than 24 hours. If the damage is where there is hair, clip that first under the bandage. When you remove it, medicate only with rose oil and threads with a little cloth. Vz.<ref id="ref177" n="177" target="en177" type="noteref">177</ref></p><p>Note. Take warm rose oil and make the tents of fine threads and spot them with rose oil and put this tepid on the wound so it is well covered with the tent. Rub around the wound with a double layer of cloth and put it over the tent and then put on another dry cloth and bind it with a bandage and let it stay that way. Treat once or twice a day, according to how serious you think the wound is, because this rose oil rapidly removes the pain and soothes the sore and also cleans it. Do this for 3 or 4 days and not more. Then take some gold unguent and medicate with this, first making the tents only of thread and putting this unguent on the wound. Then put on a bandage with this unguent on it and rub around the wound with warm rose oil. Continue in this way until it is cured because this unguent makes the flesh grow and when the flesh is ready, do not put on another tent, but you can put on a cerate of red lead or other primary plaster, according to how it seems to you, and the wound or break on the head will be cured. The patient should take care of himself for 8 to 10 days and not drink wine and stay on a diet of bread and boiled water and, with the aid of God, soon he will be cured.

The water that distills is used for its power in place of balsams. It is powerful in all illnesses from humidity and repairs coldness and clears up vision because it draws into itself all the virtues of the herbs. It opens up all abcesses, internal and external, if it is put on the painful place. It makes the tongue eloquent, if seven drops are drunk with a cyathus of good white wine when going to sleep. It hardens and draws together mercury, giving up the incorporeal spirits. If you put oil in this water, it goes at once to the bottom. Also it cooks eggs and keeps meat and fish from putrefaction. It restores and clarifies turbid wine. It takes away cataracts in the eye and any red color. It removes marks from an alb. It sharpens the intellect and makes the memory good. When it is used to rub four times in 7 days for six months, it retains and preserves health. It removes pimples, boils and all spots on the body. It removes pain from the teeth and bad odor in the nostrils, gums and jaws. It restricts cold and humidity so it makes the speech fluent. Before this water is drunk it is necessary to prepare the pills written below in two months, that is in September and October. Take them on one day yes, the next no.

Another.</hi> It has many and infinite other virtues which at present it is not possible to describe fully. Briefly speaking, for all the infirmities that can come, it restores the human body to health in a very short time.</p><p>Note in using this water. It appears that it is better and lasts longer in the winter than in the summer. It is good any time. Leave it in the bottle from which you want to use it and take it alone or with something else that is also powerful. Although it may seem warm in potency to you, it is only working on the nature of humans. It soon proceeds to consume the bad humors and it quickly removes the bad and enhances the good.</p><p>Note well that it is true that this water is so powerful that for the old, youth returns, and for the dead, living, by using it as is here below plainly said. By continuing to drink it each time as much as a grain in weight with a spoonful of water made from borage flowers, in a month the blood is renewed and the flesh, the skin, the hair and the marrow. If you are at the age of 80 years, it reduces you to the age of 40 in appearance. This has been proved by many persons in our time.</p><p>Because I told you that the dead becomes living, I tell you when a man is in extremis of death, give him a spoonful of this water in the mouth alone or with broth or wine. Bathe the forehead and wrists with this and soon he will return to life and will be able to confess and to make his testament and also will be able to live according to his age and the vigor of his natural constitution, because many have taken it and with these good effects they have continued to live for many years and many now are dead. When you see this good sign, do not give anything to eat for the space of an hour or 2 and then give some food of great substance, a little each time and repeatedly. So it aids and strengthens little by little and, with the aid of God, he will go from good to better by continuing to use this water as described above.</p><pb n="Page 322 : Folio 131v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_322.jpg" folio="131v" /><p>The third water is blood-colored. You should know that it is a most precious water because if a person uses it in the amount of half a spoonful for 15 days, in a short time he will be freed from every serious illness: lepra, phthisis, paralysis, dropsy, gout and similar problems. It can make one free without fail by the end of 2 months. We saw it work, we tested it and we proved through experience that all infirmities are healed quickly by this great water.</p><p>Note well all the times and the requirements when you or others will be ready to make the above-described elixir of life. You will need a good hour to prepare the above items, especially the spices and all the other things, little by little, following the specifications for the dry things from the apothecary's shop. Arrange with the people who bring the roots, herbs, flowers and seeds, that all be brought at one time. Do as is described above that the spices should not be ground too finely and the herbs and roots should be cut minutely and not ground. Put the raisins in intact and cut the dates and figs. Everything should be well organized, that is laid out and put on a table and each one should be known by its place, as when electuaries ar made. Then stir everything together and put everything in the flask. If all the things are fresh you will extract more virtue and substance than if they are dry. Therefore I give you this good advice as a small gift.</p><p>Also I remind you that first you prepare all the pieces of equipment that are needed, such as the main brick oven with clay and the finely-sieved ashes to hold the flask and the flask sealed and dry and the glass free of gravel or little stones because that would make it easily broken, and the charcoal to make the fire. To do the cooking, prepare the water bath and the receptacle with 2 straps to suspend the flask so it does not touch the bottom. This is an ingenious way to hold the flask in the water so the flask is not rocked about. It needs to be steady and firm like other instruments of glass that are broken by moving. Prepare the cap and the receptacle and the other ampules made of heavy glass with cloths to tie around the joints of the cap and the receptacle. Have the wood dry and soft and make the fire low and moderate. Patience must govern you and it is your teacher. With the aid of God, all things will go well and they always go from well to better. This has been set up and prepared in the clinic at Bologna and has been made many times.</p></div2>

It should be gathered it early in the morning during the half moon. Put it in a flask and put it under manure and let it stay warm for 20 days. Then remove it and distill the flask with its cover and its receptacle that has the joints well wrapped so that nothing escapes. Make the fire very low and it will distill for you a very clear and lustrous water. Then put this water in a flask and put therein the above spices, all made into powder, and the honey, wine and anise. Stopper it and put it in the sun for 10 days. Then put in all of the above herbs, flowers and roots, sliced and cut finely and let them stay thus with everything together fermenting for 2 whole days in the sun or on warm ashes. Then distill it with a very slow fire in a water bath with the cap and the receptacle and the joints closed with cloths and dough and set it up with bands so the flask stays steady in the water and does not move. When a third of this water has been distilled, watch it well and you will see the water change color. At once put a new receptacle to collect the second water and when you see that no more comes out by continuing the low fire, then put on another receptacle and increase the fire to lively. Oil colored red will come out. Put everything in its place in glass ampules that stay well sealed and save these for your needs. Below we will tell some of their virtues and some have been tested.

First in the design is the height, at least 2 arms high, more or less according to how it seems to you, made of bricks on edge or of paving tiles and mortar made of strong lime with powder of mastic, egg white and linseed oil. Incorporate everything well and make a good and strong plaster that has resistance to fire. Put the bricks on edge and join them well together, one with the other and tight. Make good plasterwork around the outside, well pressed and glazed so the water is not able to pass through. Also make good plasterwork inside. Inside the tower at the height of a palm from the bottom, put a graticule such as you see. It holds the charcoal that is put in the tower and it should be made finely of iron. Fill up the little tower with charcoal and put on its cover. Through the opening below begin the fire in the charcoal and this will go on burning little by little and the ashes will drop down through the graticule.</p><p>Then around the little tower, make a wall of a belt of bricks on end with the best plaster. On the inside around the tower there should be an opening at least half an arm's length and the tower should rise at least as much as a palm's width, more or less, above the container, according to how it seems to you. Plaster the container well....</p><pb n="Page 326 : Folio 133v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_326.jpg" folio="133v" /><note place="inline"><p>[Drawing on page.]</p></note><p>both inside and out so that water standing in it cannot pass through, either out or in. The container must not slip past the ring under the little tower which is made with art and ingenuity and with very good plaster that holds in the fire that sits in the warm water, as you see. Keep in mind when you are making the container around the philosopher's tower that you will have it full of water and that it may also have 2 or 3 or more tubes, according to what you want because it can take as many as 4, as long as they can be accomodated around it. Fill the tower with charcoal from above so that there will not be too much air or the charcoal will burn too fast because there is too much venting below. Make the fire below with an oil lamp or with a little wood and soon it will be ignited and the ashes will fall down, little by little, dropping through the graticule and also the hot charcoal, bit by bit. This fire maintains the water always very hot. It will keep it always hot for all the tubs in which the flasks are placed, conducted through to them by tubes, as you see. The tubes stay continually in the water and because of the circulation they always stay very warm. By this conduction the water in the tubs is maintained very warm and by that steady warmth the flasks distill all that you put in. You will not do better in construction than what is told to you here and in the way that you see here in the drawing.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id247402" type="ss1"><pb n="Page 327 : Folio 134r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_327.jpg" folio="134r" /><p>Also you can add other tubs, as many as can go around with the flasks inside and they will all distill with one fire if the tubes continue to carry warm water to the tubs and it distills. Put in the bottom of the tub one of those tripods, as you see, with those holes covered around with cloth or tow so that the bottom of the pot or flask sits on it securely without fear of breaking. Do it in a way that the flask is firm in the water without moving. When you see the distillate change, remove the receptace first, then its cover. Then remove your flask or pot and with dexterity remove the dregs and put in another that you want. Then return it as it was at first with its cover on and well closed with the receptacle below. With this fire you will be able to make the change 2 times a day and you will draw off a great amount of water. This water carries with it the odor and the flavor of the herbs or flowers. Whatever kinds of flowers or herbs are used, you will know by the taste of the water which kind of herb or flower it is.</p><p>This kind of water distilled in this way in the bain marie is much praised over all the other distillations of waters as being very suited to our nature. It is praised by doctors and expert physicians because, made in this way, it does not take on bad odors of any kind because the heat is continually temperate and never fails from the charcoal in the tower. As described above, the heat is always obtained when it is needed so that in the night it continues to distill and there is no danger that the water will not come out clear and beautiful.</p><p>Note that these are distilled in this way: roses, violets, carnations, jasmine or other flowers, or herbs like basil, tamarind or sage or whatever herbs are desired. You should know that the water carries with it essence from the things that you have put there. If you will do this distillation you will please the laity and especially the excellent and expert physicians who will not carry out so much boiling and decocting. It has been found that this will be more pleasing by being more delicate, clear and beautiful.</p><p>Be careful that the container that is around the tower must be covered so that the heat does not escape or go away and it should always be kept warm so it will distill more rapidly. The water should always stay full and equal to the opening of the tubes so the heat can always get out into the container of hot water and it distills readily as you have intended. This method of distilling is much used in places that have large and frequent use.</p><head>To distill various kinds of odorous waters in the bain marie.</head><p>First take some tender leaves of laurel and leaves of cedar, of lemon, of oranges, of myrtle and of greater trefoil and distill each by itself in the bain marie, as you see in the figure below. Otherwise distill as in that above where many are distilled in the bain marie. I draw this other for you in the other way so that you can take that which suits you better. Then after they are distilled, put each one by itself in the sun for 15 to 20 days, well covered, because the sun decomposes them and gives each one a certain blend composed of its special odor that when it is smelled, comforts the feelings and its odor is more gentle. This is the way to mix these waters to make an odoriferous, elegant and most invigorating water.</p><pb n="Page 328 : Folio 134v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_328.jpg" folio="134v" /><note place="inline"><p>[Drawing on page.]</p></note><p>Take the following kinds of waters distilled on the bain marie. These are odorous waters such as rose water or water of orange flowers, of myrtle, trefoil, marjoram, basil, sweet balm or jasmine or other odorous waters such as are made of cakes of rose, cedar, lemon, honeysuckle or squash flowers. Of these kinds of waters you can make a mixture of 3 or 4 or 5 kinds put together, as will be described. Take 5 lb. of rose water, 1 lb. each of trefoil, lavender and basil waters, 2 lb. of water from tender laurel leaves, 2 ½ lb. of water from cedar, 1 ½ lb. of lemon water and 3 lb. each of waters of orange flowers and of myrtle. Put all these waters together in a vitreous or tin-plated vessel. Cover it well and leave it in the sun for 3 or 4 days. Then if you wish to make it perfect and good so that your reputation is spread around, add in these things written below, that is, 3 ounces of solid storax, 4 ounces of yellow sandalwood, 1 ounce of aloe wood, 5 ounces of benzoin gum, 2 ½ ounces of cinnamon sticks, 2 ounces of cardamon or grains of paradise and 3 nutmegs. Everything should be cut up and not well-ground and the cinnamon sticks should be entire. Put all these components in the water. Stopper it well and let it stay in the hot sun for at least a month or more until it is well compounded together. Otherwise you can boil it on a slow fire, well covered, for a half hour.</p><p>Then you can scent the water with musk in this way. Have a flask for 6 or 7 lb. and put therein 4 to 6 grains of musk finely ground with 2 or 3 drops of good oil or with 3 drops of brandy and with fine sugar. With this you can make 3 or 4 kinds of perfumes with ambergris, with civet and with camphor or with other odors as you or anyone wishes. When you have composed it, let it stay in the sun for 15 to 20 days, well covered, and you will have a very odorous and elegant essence to give to any noble, high-class, elegant person.</p></div2>

Then put on some very warm water that covers them at least four fingers deep. Cover the vessel well and put it in a place that will stay warm, if you can, and let it stay thus for at least 6 to 8 days until it is heated together. Stir it every day with a rod or with the hands, bottom to top, so that everything incorporates well. Then distill the mixture in the still of your choice. If you distill it in a lead still it is truly good and odorous. But if you distill it in glass in the way described above, it will come out better for you, clearer and more fragrant.

Put on the lid of the flask and put it in a suitable place to distill with its receptacle below. Seal the joints with linen cloth and with dough so that in distilling no gases escape. Distill with a very slow fire or distill on a bain marie which is better and makes it more odorous. Then when it is distilled, let it stay at least 15 days in the sun.

By following this rule, all your waters will be preserved well and completely and they will last a long time. On the contrary, if you take them before they are mature and distill them, the waters will not last and soon are spoiled and the water becomes slimy and viscous. At that time you need to break it up and filter it or redistill it again. It is true that the water is not as perfect as it was at first, but it is good.</p></div2>

If you know how to carry out the distillation you will never be a poor man. Note down the present method, viz.</p><p type="div3" id="id249077"> <hi rend="bold">The main thing that you have to do.</hi> Make a round vessel of clay as you see before you in the figure, not thicker of clay than a thumb with a retaining ring inside that is 2 fingers above the little opening below and the thickness of a thumb and the same depth outward. Then make a vessel of fine copper to the height of 2 or 3 fingers above the tower that can fit inside it and be well-sealed inside because it will be full of warm water. The flask will go inside it with its cover. Under it the lighted lamp is put in the opening with a piece of tile in front to close it. This burns night and day.</p><p type="div3" id="id249088"> <hi rend="bold">When all the above pieces of equipment have been made, prepare the wine.</hi> I say that you should take a red wine, not white, if you have it. If not, use the white but dark or red is always better. The wine that you want should be good and very fragrant and pure without water. The better it is, the better the brandy, more potent, fragrant and odorous. Therefore, take this wine and put it in the flask, half full or a little more and seal it well. Then put it to ferment, that is, prepare it in this way. Put it for 12 to 15 days in the center of warm ashes and every day add a little more warmth, always agitating the wine, moving it upside down. Do it always carefully so the flask does not break. If you do not want to leave it in ashes, put it in horse manure and let it stay in a warm place for 15 days because....</p><pb n="Page 344 : Folio 141v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_344.jpg" folio="141v" /><p>at the end of this time you will distill it. The better the wine, the more potent it is in everything such as odor, taste and its virtue is to be praised.</p><p>Then put the flask with wine into the warm copper vessel and put therein tepid water until the vessel is full and the flask fits well and does not move on any side. Do everything with dexterity. Then put the cap on the flask and bind around the joint, wrapping it with dough and fit it well so that nothing can get out or put other plaster around that is suitable to retain the gases so that none can escape. Fit its receptacle on securely and lute it well with either dough or clay so the gases are not able to escape. Then below put the lamp or other suitable light that will have the same effect as the lamp which should be large enough to hold at least one pound of oil and the wick or lighted part should be at least more or less equal in thickness to the little finger as it seems to you. Put it in the little window so the fire heats the bottom of the copper cauldron so it heats the water well. In this way the wine is distilled to make a perfect brandy. Then put a little tile in front of the opening of the lamp so that it closes but does not block the lamp or it could not burn, but the heat stays within. This will make the distillation very slow and this is the important rule of distilling brandy because too rapid distillation will not make perfect brandy and the body comes out mixed with the spirit. We have studied the separation of the spirit from the body and our studies showed that the distillation should be slow and the lamp should not be removed from below either day or night. Because it is needed, do not run out of oil so your work stays steadily warm and continues to distill. When you see the distillation change, remove the fire and let it cool well and handle it carefully so that you do not break the equipment.</p><p>Note that when you have done the first heating, you will have extracted all the spirit and nothing of the spirit remains in the body. Do the test in this way, viz. Take a little card and wet it in the distilled water from the bain marie, that is in the last that has seemed to you not as good as the first that was coming. Touch it to the fire and the water will burn but the card will remain wet. With the second distillation, wet the card and touch it to the fire. The water will burn and it will leave the card dry. If you do this for the third distillation, the water will burn and also the card at once. This is the sign that it is all spirit and nothing of the body is in it. Through the long distillation it has become all spirit, as you can see. Then the brandy has become all goodness. If you will have it more potent, you can distill it 4, 5, 6 or 7 times and it will be perfect and if you continue to 10 distillations, it adds little because much is lost but it will be the most perfect and best. I say it is the best elixir of life and compares with balsam in its properties.</p><p>Note that the first distilled water is good to drink as something simple and pure. All those that follow from the other distillations are not good to drink undiluted because they could irritate internally and exhaust a man. They are good to bathe only externally and to treat....</p><pb n="Page 345 : Folio 142r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_345.jpg" folio="142r" /><p>all the infirmities of the human body, doing it in the way that will be described in full below of its virtues. It is true that little is available of this kind of brandy because it is too expensive, troublesome, laborious and vexatious to make. This is a product for great, noble and high-class persons who do not care about expense or labor and want it to be made and it costs what it is worth. This is enough to have said about this brandy which is made from the most perfect wine in the bain marie and is not as other brandies, usually made of putrid wine, that the grocers sell. At the end of this chapter, how to make brandy from poor wine will be described. The brandy described above is made only by our Reverend Priors of the Jesuati Friars. I say it is greatly superior and perfect because they use great care in extracting only the substance, so for drinking it has no equal. It is pure and without fault.</p><p>Note that when you need to change the flasks, always have one or 2 flasks ready with wine that has been fermented or distilled so that as soon as you have removed one flask from the fire, you have another prepared and immediately put it in the water bath and put in warm water so that it is soon heated hot with the lamp. In this way you will make your distillation quick and good. Throw away that remaining in the flask, for you have removed the substance of it and it is of no more value. It is called the first distillation. But do not throw away that remaining in the flask after the second, third and fourth or later distillations. These are good to put in a little bottle with vinegar because that makes the vinegar strong and potent and therefore do not throw it away. Also the remains of the wine are used especially for dying stamped leathers or cordovans when the wine is dark.</p><p>To begin the virtues of this brandy, or burning water, daily use of the first, second and third distillations is approved by many persons. The first distillation will burn but its fire does not consume or burn cloth but leaves it damp and wet. The second distillation will burn and does not consume cloth but leaves it dry and arid. The third distillation will burn and the cloth will be consumed entirely. The fourth distillation is very potent and strong. The more times the wine is distilled, the stronger and more potent it will be. So the seventh distillation will consume everything to which it is applied.</p><p>The virtue of the first distillation is that if you wash the face and nose three times and you put a little in the nose, it clears the passages and soothes the brain. It clears the sight and strengthens retracted nerves. Washing the exterior of the head improves memory and all the qualities of the spirit. If you put in any kind of spices that you would like, either the flowers or the herbs, chopped up, in 2 hours or more the brandy will draw out all the virtue and substance of the spices. You can give the clergy at table a wine spiced with cloves and sage and similar fragrances. When you have made up this water, put 3 or 4 drops in a glass of wine and it will give the taste of that which you have put in and it will keep its odor. It improves the appetite and soothes the stomach when taken in the morning and evening. It removes the phlegm that is in the opening of the stomach and removes the bad gas that comes either in the stomach or in the head. When it is taken twice a day with a small quantity of wine it soon restores the stomach.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id249358" type="ss1"><pb n="Page 346 : Folio 142v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_346.jpg" folio="142v" /><p>There is no cold venom that it cannot draw out, such as terrestrial spider, serpent, fly or scorpion. If one puts a cloth wet in this water on the serpent or similar poisonous animal, it is dead at once, even if it does not touch them and does the same for any other cold venom. Washing the bite of the spider or the serpent several times with this water may cure it and drinking some with wine. It has power like the balsams and the greater theriac. If ringworm or scabies is washed twice a day it will remove it. Put a little lye in the water and let it stay for a day and a night and then put 2 or 3 drops in the ear and any noise that often comes goes away at once. If you put an amount of germander in this water equal to the weight of the water or alternatively as much human blood and let everything stay together for a day and a night and then put 3 or 4 drops in a deaf ear and do this 3 or 4 times and the ear will be freed from deafness, from whatever cause. This cure is made with the dry herb. This water cures every toothache that comes from cold humors. It is true that washing the teeth with it kills the worms and the humors that hide in the root of the teeth. It relieves the distress of paralysis and every infirmity of the nerves by washing with it. This water penetrates so well that when a drop is put in the center of the hand, at once and without any harm it will penetrate into the hand. It cures swelling of the feet, legs and joints and reduces any infirmity that comes from cold phlegm or infected blood as long as it is used in the way described above. Note that this water always stays clear, I say, very clear and it is excellent in every degree and, in my judgment, the most excellent that can be found.</p><head>The properties written above and those written below are properties and virtues of brandy or ‘burning water’ which have all been tested. Viz.</head><p>First, it cures all the aches which afflict our body, I say, if such afflictions are caused by cold humors. If the distress is internal, give the patient an amount to drink that will fill the shell of hazelnut, mixed in a glass of good white wine. If the distress is external, rub with this water mixed with wine as described. In the morning drink 2 or 3 drops mixed with white wine on an empty stomach, and do not exceed this measure or it will make the man too merry. Also it cures bad breath, that is the fetid odor that comes from the stomach. Also it cures the falling sickness when it is drunk as described above and is rubbed on the head.</p><p type="div3" id="id249399"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It is very powerful against the paralysis with tremor of the limbs by drinking it and rubbing it in the above way. Also if the infirm person holds a little cloth wet with this water on his tongue, it improves and gives back speech. Note that it does not have any effect on the natural infirmity except once in a while.</p><p type="div3" id="id249415"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> Putting some of this water in grape must clears it up at once and makes it beautiful and clear.</p><p type="div3" id="id249428"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It is powerful against the sickness of stone when that is caused by cold humors, whether the stone is in the kidney or the bladder, if the water is drunk as described above.</p><pb n="Page 347 : Folio 143r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_347.jpg" folio="143r" /><p type="div3" id="id249450"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It is powerful against pain in the testicles that is caused by cold humors. Note that this water is of 2 kinds, that is simple and mixed. Simple is when it is not mixed with other things and must work alone, that is without wine or water to drink. This is the most inestimable of all medicines, the mother and the lady, which has marvelous effects against all the cold sufferings. In conclusion, this water cures all distress from cold as long as a man knows how to use its powers, because when it is brought near the fire it immediately burns. This is the measure and amount when you want to use it, take one dram up to 2, more or less, according to the patient's need.</p><p type="div3" id="id249472"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It is powerful against headache even if it be long-standing. It cleans the head of dandruff. It cures all the sores of scabies when the head is washed each day with this water. It gives great aid to the memory. It is powerful in that illness that people call lunacy when it is drunk as described and when the head is rubbed and it is smelled with the nose. If you will dissolve a little fine theriac in this water and take it in the morning on an empty stomach, 2 or 3 or more times, it will cure you completely and well.</p><p type="div3" id="id249492"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> It is very powerful in the sickness of palsy when administered as described above.

But you should know that the first water distilled from the first vapor is very lively and much more precious than the subsequent ones and is better in every good way. If the distillation is repeated many times it will be more powerful. The more times you distill it, the more you will lose because some consumed by evaporation. That is to say, from a large container or a barrel of wine, the first distillation extracts only a fourth or fifth part. It is very true that the power is increased by repeated distillations, as the philosophers say who were the first inventors to find the method and the rules to make it in the way described above. The first doctrine was obtained as a revelation from the Angel called Raphael, that is the Healer from God, whose water works many marvels. You should know that of ten measures that you distill, it is usual to get out a tenth part or a little more. It is true that if the wine is very strong and lively and is distilled in the way described above, it will be twice that or a fifth part and that would be a good amount from the first distillation of the wine. Then if you distill a second time, for every 2 measures you put in to distill, you will get out one measure or half the amount you put in to distill. If you distill one more time the part that you have extracted in the second distillation and distill it well a third time, from 5 measures you will get out 4. If you distill the fourth time in good form you will extract the same amount that you put in the still or a little less. If you want to come to peak perfection, you will distill the fifth, sixth or seventh time and time after time you will drop in amount as you change from one vessel to the other in the distillation. In the seventh distillation the water is called perfect because it does things that are very wonderful and worthwhile. The tenth distillation, that little which is gathered, is called most perfect because it ennobles and cleanses all things.</p><p type="div3" id="id249722"> <hi rend="bold">First.</hi> Because of the great effort and expense, for ordinary medication when the brandy made in the way described, the dose is one dram up to two or more, according to the state of the patient.</p><p type="div3" id="id249733"> <hi rend="bold">2. Another.</hi> It is so powerful that if fur, hair, linen or wool cloth are rubbed with it and brought near to the fire or to a burning candle, the wet thing bursts into flame without being consumed, and this happens to any other material. It is a marvelous thing that the water burns and not the thing bathed in this water. Using this water keeps gray hair in abeyance.</p><p type="div3" id="id249750"> <hi rend="bold">3.

Also, it dries up tears when the eye is rinsed out and a drop is put in the corner of the eye. It will dry the eye and support it and remove the tears.

If you wish to make the test, take a chicken plucked and cleaned inside and scalded so hot that it hurts the hand. Then wet it well with this brandy that is warm, inside and out, 3 or 4 times. Then leave it in the sun for 2 or 3 hours and it will be preserved for 10 years and never be spoiled.

First you make a pot of copper in 3 pieces well soldered and joined together and well fastened and well welded with very good tin inside and out if that can be done. This pot is in the form that you see with a tube well fastened together and soldered inside and out so that no gases can escape. Place the tube in the part above to put in wine or brandy and another length that comes out of the oven in the part below which serves to draw out the wine that is at the bottom and also the water when there is no more spirit in it. Close this from above very well and firmly so you are able to overcome the danger that boiling or other obstacles may cause, because all the material that is within may come out with force. So make a good stopper of tow from above so that no drops or material can cause the problem.</p><p>Wall the pot inside the oven as shown here so that the tube is clear. Make it fit in a way that it holds the heat well and make a space below to place the fire with its chimney in front and with a little opening behind to give it a little vent for a flow of air.

It should be well fastened with cloth and strong plaster that does not fear heat or water and so it cannot ever leak air because all the good gas may be lost. Be advised that above that place you should make drops of cold water fall because.....</p><pb n="Page 351 : Folio 145r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_351.jpg" folio="145r" /><note place="inline"><p>[Drawing on page.]</p></note><p>that greatly aids in recovering the spirits that are coming out in that place and they are quickly condensed. The water in the box is not warmed much because the spirits come out more easily and without difficulty.</p><p>Then you fit the coil in a box or other container to hold water. The coil should be under water and the water always cold. The gases should be transformed in the part below the water because the coil above the water always stays warmer than that below. The gases are converted by the cold to a liquid which issues from the end of the coil out of the box. See that the connection there is well closed with plaster and plugged so that the water does not get in. In this way the brandy will come out and put a flask or receptacle to collect the distilled brandy. Keep it well covered with a cloth so that the odor does not evaporate because that is the great virtue of its substance.</p><p>Note that you can make a belt of lead in a spiral or snail in the way that you see here in the figure with 4 to 6 turns and about the thickness of a thumb. It is provided with 4 rods that hold it in place, well tied so that it will always be firm, and soldered to hold it right, as you see. Put this in a large vat or in a half barrel which should always be....</p><pb n="Page 352 : Folio 145v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_352.jpg" folio="145v" /><p>full and cold. The end of the coil extends out of the vat in a suitable way so that with good plaster and tow the water cannot exit. Use either of these two, whichever is turned more easily for you, because both work and have the same effect. Also if either kind of spiral is made so there are 4 turns, either lead or copper is very good and useful. But be careful that the spiral does not have some fissure that would do harm because the water could enter and will do you no good and all the work will be gone for that boiling. Save the distilled brandy as described above in a vessel or cask that is well sealed. You can distill it the second time whenever you want because in this form it will last for a year. It is better preserved in one boiling than in two. It is not possible to keep the second boiling a long time because much of the delicacy will be lost and it will never be as good at the end as it was at first.</p><p>When you put the wine in the pot always make the pot more than half full but not too much more, so in the first boiling the wine does not jump up in the cap and that distilling will not be good. After the first boiling, reduce the fire a little each time, as is said above, and keep it maintained so that it never fails. When you want to change the wine, remove the fire from below so that there is no obstacle for the pot. As you distill the wine, take a measure of the brandy that is coming from the distillation and when it seems to you that the taste is not as good and it does not have the odor of brandy, throw it out for it is not good any more.</p><p>When you do the second distillation use the same test and furthermore drop a little on your arm. If it does not sting there is no more spirit in it and if you see that it burns, let it stay longer. When it has no more spirit, remove it from the fire and throw it away and put the other in, little by little, until you finish the work you have begun. It is very true that the dregs of wine have uses. They tan leather to make a dark color. The base of the second distillation and the third are used to put in bottles of vinegar because they reinforce the vinegar marvelously and maintain it.</p><p>Note that the first brandy that comes from the second distillation is always stronger and more potent than all the others that come out and you are advised to keep it always separate. Again I remind you to keep it closed all the time with wax and covered with good parchment so that nothing can evaporate, for if the odor leaves it has no more power.</p><p>Note that if you distill from good, great and aromatic red wine, it will make lively and aromatic brandy. If you make it from bad, spoiled and turbid wine as long as the bad is not strong and if the wine itself was good and aromatic before it went bad, it will make good brandy, lively and aromatic when distilled in the way described. If you follow this method you will get good results.</p><p>Note that the first water is much used with ground spices added and mixed with the second water, but it is not worth anything to drink. If the second distillation is drunk it results in many good cures, the applications of which you will learn below with its weights, measures, tests and quality that expert philosophers have discovered and have put to use as medicine to treat many kinds of erythema and this has been published in many volumes. Below we will tell of its virtues, weights and carats and how valuable it is for the human body.</p><pb n="Page 353 : Folio 146r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_353.jpg" folio="146r" /><p>Note the strengths of the brandy described above. The first thing is to recognize and know if it is good to drink or not. When you have made the second distillation, wet a little parchment and touch it to the fire. If the parchment remains wet afterward, this brandy is good to drink and it is from 15 to 16 carats. This applies from the first that issues out to the last. If you wet the parchment in the brandy from the third distillation, the brandy all burns and leaves the parchment dry. Such brandy is not good to drink because it has reached from 18 up to 24 carats, beginning with the first brandy that comes out of this third boiling until the last drop. This is known as the fiery brandy which is not good to drink because drinking this brandy, unlike that from the second distillation, burns the liver and the interior and dries up the blood so very soon it will make you die. Be advised to use this for rubbing and for wetting and to make other applications but do not drink it, unless you wish to drink 3 or 4 drops in a glass of wine or with water for some specific infirmity, as described below.</p><p>Of the many tested virtues of this brandy, I say the first distillation is good to drink when it is made of the best red wine and it does not disturb anything in our bodies. The second brandy is that which has reached 16 carats. I tell you that if you drink this early in the morning, it breaks the choler in the stomach. One may have a stomach impeded by phlegm or by cold humors or may have bloating from flatulence and that may make the stomach acid and the food in it. This acidification is called burning in the stomach. When this impediment comes to you after a meal you should drink as much as fits in a walnut shell. In a quarter of an hour, drink another little amount and do this 2 or 3 times. This saves the food in the stomach so that it is not spoiled in acid and also improves the digestion. Also it is very powerful when there is pain in the top of the stomach and in the arch of the chest or behind a nipple or in the middle of the chest. This distress comes in the greater part from bloat that presses the chest so strongly that in a few hours it causes a spasm and such an infirmity develops in a short time. To cure it rapidly, drink at least an ounce and a half or more early in the morning in the space of an hour and it will be very useful and helpful to you.</p><p>If you take 3 ounces of this brandy and 2 ounces of rose honey and incorporate them together in a bottle and drink one ounce of this as soon as you get out of bed, there will be none of the great distress of the stomach nor the great dullness of the head. Continue with this beverage because it does not work very quickly. In this method the liver and blood will not be harmed and it will not cause any other little problem. It repairs and puts in order all the bad dispositions of the stomach that hurt you in various ways and it will make you happy, give you a good stomach, increase your appetite and always support the food in the stomach. Take it even before meals and then the food will never upset you. Use it when you need it and you will see the proof. I can prove all of this to you because I have found that in the summer this with rose honey soon makes well those who have trouble with the stomach. This beverage can also be used by women who can partake of it without any concern. And this.....</p><pb n="Page 354 : Folio 146v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_354.jpg" folio="146v" /><p>beverage is very useful. It purifies the eye of any impediment and does many more marvelous things that I do not describe about this infirmity. Especially it resolves the flatulence that causes dangerous spasmodic pains and makes them go away through the mouth. It breaks down the flatulence into belches and the more it makes you belch, that is a sign that it is working well.</p><p>Also it is very powerful in toothache when the problem comes from cold rheum and from coldness. Hold it in the mouth on the sore side until it does not have any more taste or odor. Then spit it out and take some more so that it draws out that mucous discharge well. If you want to cure this, when you go to sleep in the evening, bathe the cheek, the forehead and the ear on the side where the pain is. Also do this in the morning and soon it will lift your pain and you will be cured because this brandy marvelously strengthens sick flesh that is bothered by pain. The flesh becomes better and is rapidly cured. Use this with confidence that you will gain honor from it.</p><p>Also drinking one ounce 2 or 3 times in the space of an hour is very powerful for those who have eaten sorb apples, pears, chestnuts, cornelian cherries, sour grapes, pears or quinces or any other fruit that sticks in the throat, anything that is not able to go down or up, at once it frees it so there is no more such distress. Drinking it in this way frees those who have hiccoughs from flatulence of the stomach, from whatever cause.<ref id="ref189" n="189" target="en189" type="noteref">189</ref></p><p>Also if you have a cask of wine that has turned and was clear, at once change it to another clean barrel that does not have a bad odor. For each barrel of wine put in 4 ounces of 16 carat brandy. When you have it all decanted, mix it in the barrel with a stick of willow and put in one leaf of clary and no more, tied with a string that goes half way down the barrel. Fasten it and let it stay for at least 4 or 5 days. Then take it out and do not infuse it more. This wine can be drunk and will not offend anyone. This has been tested.</p><p>Note that brandy that has been distilled 3 times will be from 18 to 24 carats. This is not good to drink, as has been said. But it is good to bathe the head, the forehead, the eyes and the nose for one who suffers from coldness and when the person has a annoying cold in the head that involves the eyes and from that the distress of coughing. In the evening when you go to bed, put a little on your hand and wet the forehead and the head in front and behind on the neck. Do this 3 or 4 times. Then cover your head with a night cap or other little cap or with a head towel and cover it well so it stays warm. Then raise both hands to the nose and draw up in the nose the odor that will go to your brain and comfort it greatly. You will sleep well in the night and in the morning you will be more than half cured. Do this the next evening and you will be completely cured. When a person has washed and dried the head and that evening rubs the head with this brandy and keeps it from any humidity, it will make the hair soft and delicate.</p><p>Again, it is good for one who has the problem of a sick spleen. Bathe the painful place repeatedly and keep it warm with cloth and a warm stupe and soon you will be cured. Also it is powerful for one who has damaged any nerve by cold. Bathe repeatedly with this brandy which always should be made warm in a well-covered bottle so it does not evaporate and it soon cures. Again, if you put any kind of odoriferous spices in this brandy, it will at once take up the odor and the taste that the spice carries. If you put in 2 or 3 drops of musk or other odoriferous thing, it augments the odor greatly. If you put ground crimson dye to soak in this brandy for one whole day, it will take up all the color and have a beautiful luster. Incorporate this with other brandy and it will turn out very beautiful for you.</p><p>This is enough to have said of all the kinds of brandy with their virtues, weights, measures and carats.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id250422" type="ss1"><pb n="Page 355 : Folio 147r" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_355.jpg" folio="147r" /><note place="inline"><p>[Drawing on page.]</p></note><head>An improvisation to distill good brandy, designed for a sample.</head><p>In order to show persons desiring to know more things, we will demonstrate how it is possible to distill brandy as well as fiery brandy while he is eating at table, having first prepared the vessels described here that you intend to fill. This is done as an experiment to show the great potency and force that wine has, I say the distilled vapor.</p><p>First take a flask or a urinal, that is better, and make it half full of wine but not more. It should be good, great and potent red wine, by nature pure and without added water. Cover the urinal with 2 leaves of parchment for writing and it should be doubled into 4 and well tied at the top with fine twine, as you see. Fit it directly in the center of a pot and fill the pot with ashes that have been finely and carefully sieved and with your hand arrange the ashes around the urinal with dexterity so that it is not broken and fill the pot.</p><p>Then fit the pot on 4 bricks so that there is a space of at least 4 fingers below. Put under this some warm ashes and lighted charcoal so that it heats the pot with the ashes and then the wine will heat and it will distill. When you have arranged it as it should be, put the cap on the parchment. Take a cloth, wet it with clay or with soft dough, and put it around the joint of the cap and wrap it well so nothing can escape from any side. Then put the receptacle underneath the cap and put more plaster around that joint so nothing can escape from any side and arrange it in the way that you see.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id250490" type="ss1"><pb n="Page 356 : Folio 147v" facs="ksrl.sc.prycemse1_356.jpg" folio="147v" /><p>By keeping to the rule described above and with a little fire, the water will distill properly and well because first the pot is heated, then the ashes heat the urinal, the wine vaporizes and hits on the parchment and moistens it and the urinal heats the cap and that draws the moisture out from the parchment and distills it into the receptacle. This makes very good brandy that is good to drink. However, it is not the best but it is enough to have seen the way and the rule as it is done to make the brandy described above. This is the amount that you will get out, 4 or 5 ounces of brandy per jug of wine and that will be sufficient if the wine was good, as was said above. In this way you will have achieved your purpose and this is enough.</p><head>Sage wine for contracted nerves and for lunacy and it is very powerful in paralysis.</head><p>Wine from sage is made in 2 ways, viz. Some put the sage in a sachet of fine linen cloth and bind it with a thread and put it in a cask at least half full of wine, tie it from above and let it stay in the wine. Some boil it when the must is boiled and they put this with wine in a cask or crockery pot or barrel. In both these 2 ways this wine is good in all the infirmities written below, using more or less according to the seriousness of the infirmity. Usually it is taken early in the morning or a glass is drunk before a meal or with all meals or the bad place is bathed, depending on the infirmity that must be treated. Especially it is good for one who has a toothache or loose teeth and in pain of the gums, by holding it warm in the mouth. It is powerful for every weak limb with tremor and for every bad humor and in paralysis when it is drunk repeatedly. It is powerful in headache and in contracted limbs and nerves. It is powerful against lunacy in those who at one period of the moon lose their normal reason. They should continue to drink it. It is powerful in stomach ache and in women with sickness of pregnancy. In conclusion, it is powerful in all nervous conditions of all human creatures and many have used it.</p><p type="div3" id="id250522"> <hi rend="bold">Another wine against paralysis and against every cold infirmity.</hi> Take cinnamon in whatever quantity you wish, break it into fine pieces and put it in good wine and let it stay covered for 8 days in the sun to decompose. Then distill it with the cinnamon in a glass still on a slow fire or on a bain marie. In the morning give 2 ounces of this water, more or less according to the strength of the sick person. This is effective in paralysis and in many other cold infirmities.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id250542" type="ss1"><head>Wine made of fennel that is powerful for cough, for the lungs and for defective eyes.</head><p>Take any amount that you wish of the herb fennel or its roots or seeds and boil it in must and put it in 2 casks or barrels and let it stay there. Use it according to the infirmity, more or less as you find it appropriate in your infirmity. This wine is good against haze and other defects of the eyes, against dropsy, against weakness and especially in little children and against venoms and bad food and it helps greatly in cough and the lungs. It increases milk in women and is powerful for sickness of the bladder. Drinking this wine in the evening when you go to sleep and in the morning as soon as you arise cleans out all the bad humors. If you use it at meals it is especially good for the eyes and maintains your eyesight for a long time.</p></div2>

A wine made for sickness of the eyes.</hi> Take one handful each of the herbs eyebright, betony and carnation that are fresh and clean and 3 handfuls each of flowers of elder, dill and fennel. Put all these herbs and flowers in your wine vessel to boil and let them stay in the wine. Use this wine to drink all the time for yourself alone or with others who may have problems with vision such as lacking distance vision or other difficulties. If you continue taking this wine by drinking at least 3 ounces in the morning, it clears the vision so you will never have problems with the eyes, through God's grace.</p><head>Wine of birthwort that is powerful against fistulas as long as they do not reach the bone.</head><p>Take 2 handfuls of fresh long birthwort and 1 handful of fresh round birthwort and boil them a little in wine. Remove them and cut them finely and boil them in ½ barrel of wine that is good by itself but not sweet and it should be white. Boil this on a slow fire until it foams well and reduces almost 2/3. Then strain it carefully with linen cloth. Be careful that it does not touch copper and save it in a glass bottle or other delicate bottle. Drink 2 ounces of this in the evening when you go to sleep and 3 ounces when you get up in the morning. Continue this for 2 months so the cold of the ulcer will come out. Watch how you take care of yourself. Do not eat fat meat nor beef, nor cheese, nor other adverse things. On the wound or on the sore, put some powder made of roots of round birthwort or blow some of the above powder into the sore. In a few days the fistula will be healed as long as it has not become deep-rooted in the bone. You should know that birthwort is warm and dry in the second degree so it has the virtue of growing flesh in a ulcer and also cleans it.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id250650" type="ss1"><head>Wine against cold gout.</head><p>Take some turbith, the amount at your discretion, and put it with good white wine in a pot and let it stay in the sun continuously for 3 days, well-covered. Each day turn it upside down. Give 1 or 2 ounces of it to drink in the early morning, according to the strength of the patient. When you give it to him to drink, put in a little powdered sugar. By continuing this drinking he will soon be cured. Also this wine can be used to clean the blood and to stop blood flowing from the body. In any similar infirmity put into this wine things appropriate for the infirmity.</p><p type="div3" id="id250670"> <hi rend="bold">Wine against any flatulence and other problems.</hi> Take 3 ounces each of celery seeds, bishop's weed and dry mint, 1 ounce each of mastic, cloves, cardamon, red roses and wild roses, 2 ounces each of fine cinnamon, musk, zedoary and iris and 4 ounces of fine sugar. Do not break up any of these if they are not large and incorporate everything with one pound of cleaned honey. Put everything in a cask of good and pure white wine. Drink 4 ounces of this in the evening when you go to sleep and this brings out the cold and removes flatulence. If a woman drinks it every evening and is with her husband, soon it prepares the womb to become pregnant. It helps carry the baby in the body to its time without danger and supports the womb. If the baby may be dead in the womb it causes abortion without any danger. It also has many other properties, especially for women. It is tested.</p></div2>

Everything should be broken up coarsely. Incorporate them together with 2 jugs of good white wine, not sweet, and boil them together on a slow fire in a clean pot that has no odor, until it reduces 1/4. Then strain it with linen cloth and save it in a well-covered flask. In the evening when the woman wishes to go to sleep, give 3 ounces to drink, tepid, and with God's grace soon it will benefit her stomach and this beverage will ease pain of the womb.

<div2 id="id250763" type="ss1"><head>How to transform quickly turbid and sour wine with other bad odors.</head><p>When you have a cask of wine that has become cloudy, take one egg for each barrel of wine and ½ ounce each of saccharine alum, ground glass and marble powder and incorporate everything until it makes a mass that sticks together. Then distemper it with a little brandy from the third distillation. Then put this material in the cask of cloudy wine that is not too full and stir with wine well with a stick. Otherwise transfer the wine to another vessel that has a good odor and put in this composition and incorporate it well. Cover it and let it rest for 3 or 4 days and you will find it clear and beautiful and drinkable. Also if you take some unripe cherries and put them in the wine, usually it will be changed and become clear and beautiful.</p><p type="div3" id="id250802"> <hi rend="bold">Wine that has lost its fragrance and has soured.</hi> Take some clean wax and make a covered box that is long and has an opening above and fill it with good honey and plug it so the honey cannot get out and tie it around with a ribbon and put it in the cask of wine that has become sour to the depth of a palm from the bottom.

Then test the wine and if this by itself has removed much of the odor, remove the sack and the wine will be restored. If not, leave the sack in so that the wine will soon be restored so you will be able to drink it. Also when the wine is in the cask, put in a few ashes made from clematis and the wine will never become sour.</p></div2>

By the power of the brandy, you will preserve it and augment the odor and taste that is always good. Also if you put in some tamarind flowers, that also preserves it, but be careful that the flowers are not spoiled. If you want to give a good odor to the wine, put therein some juniper wood cut in pieces, not too small, and put it in the must when it is boiling and it will take on the odor you wish.</p><p type="div3" id="id250920"> <hi rend="bold">Another to give the wine the odor of muscatel.</hi> Take flowers of clary or honeysuckle, in whatever amount you want, and dry it in the shade and make powder.

Change your wine when the north wind reigns and not at other times and when the moon is waning. If you change it in the waxing moon, it is in great danger of turning and becoming harsh. Be warned about this. You want to change wines that grow in dry, rocky, arid and hilly places at Christmas and other wines right after the feast day of any saint. When these wines are decanted, you want the moon to be gone or nearly at its end. Watch that you do not decant wines when roses and especially grape vines are blossoming, because this would put you in great peril. You should know that the more times you decant wines, the weaker they become, because they always lose some substance that they had at first. When you want to preserve soundness, make sure they stay in a cool place in the summertime and in the winter in a warm pantry. That is, you decant wine into warm or cool pantry according to the temperature. By keeping to this rule, your wines will always be well preserved.</p></div2>
<div2 id="id251056" type="ss1"><head>To make spoiled wine return to the way it was at first and never again be spoiled.</head><p>Take 6 lb. of tartar from wine and grind it coarsely and make fine powder and extract the water with 2 flasks as is done in making <hi rend="italic">aqua forte</hi> . At the end there it needs enough fire so the flask is dry and the calcined tartar remains within. Then take that oil or water that has issued from the flask and likewise take an equal amount by weight of strong brandy from the third distillation. Then pulverize the tartar that you have calcined and put it in another flask and add the oil mixed with the brandy and redistill it one more time. Then do it again. Distill it in this way enough times so that the tartar will have imbibed all the oil and brandy and it can be made into powder. Save this as something dear. This powder is called the Philosopher's Stone. You should know that one ounce or a little more of this powder will restore a cask of 10 barrels of spoiled wine. First decant it into another cask with a good odor and put in this powder, mixing it in with a rod so that it goes throughout. Then close it well and let it stay so for 30 days. Then test it and, with the aid of God, you will find all restored and as good as at first. This secret is from Bologna from one man who has the skill to repair wines from other persons.

Soon you will urinate and will feel better, through the grace of God. If you may be subject to this infirmity, wear a belt of intestine for a whole month and you will never have pain in the side. I say on bare flesh. This has been tested many times.</p><p>If you bind it on the body of an animal that you think may have pain, leave it for all of a day or a night and, with the aid of God, the animal will be cured. When it urinates it is freed and cured. If a bone is found in the intestine of the wolf, that is good against toothache. Hold it in the mouth if you can. Also if you spread out the intestine of the wolf over a doorway, wherever it is, neither cow, nor horse, nor mule, nor ass will pass under it.</p><p type="div3" id="id252269"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> The flesh of the wolf, cooked and eaten, heals wild behavior and dropsy wonderfully and also may cure quartan fever.</p><p type="div3" id="id252282"> <hi rend="bold">Another.</hi> The flesh of the wolf has the same medicinal powers as that of the fox. Take the meat and brine it well so it takes up the salt. Then wash it with vinegar or wine. Put it to dry in the shade and when it is very dry, save it in a dry place for your needs, from which God guard you. When a large beast has fallen ill, ox, cow, mule, horse, mare, ass or other animal that has the serious illness of urinating blood or other pains, do this at once. Take some of the meat of the wolf and as much as of a fox, cut it finely and grind about a bowlful well. Boil it in 2 jugs of good white wine for a half hour. Remove it from the fire and let it cool until you can bear it on your finger. Then have a funnel of horn and with dexterity pour it down the throat with force. Do this in the morning and the evening. If the illness is recent, only for one day, it will be cured rapidly. Then give the animal its bran mash to drink with wheat meal and tepid water. Be quick to give this medicine because if you should be negligent, the beast will die because the sickness may send it in 3 days. The flesh of the wolf is not good for anything except the rump at the rear. Do not touch the remainder for it will make you ill.</p><p type="div3" id="id252314"> <hi rend="bold">Another, a beverage for similar animals and a good remedy.</hi> Take 1 ½ jugs of good white wine, 3 ounces of good theriac and 1 lb. of male pork lard that is old and crush it finely. Take 1 lb. of finely-ground marble and incorporate everything together and put it on the fire to boil a little until the lard is melted. Remove it and let it cool and when you can bear to put your finger in it, then pour it down the throat with the funnel using force as described above. Do this 2 or 3 times. If, at the end of 3 days, the animal lives, you have won. Do not let it drink cold water and keep it warm with a good stable. Keep it away from other animals so they do not catch the illness because it is easily caught. This has been tested many times in large animals. Especially if you see that an animal does not eat, suspect a similar illness and at once use the remedy of the above medicine because in 2 days it may become clear that the animal cannot survive because the blood is too contaminated. That contaminated blood goes to the heart and soon it will die. Always keep to the rump of the flesh of the wolf and the fox for this kind of sickness.</p></div2>

I want you to know this prayer because it is appropriate to the pain of the horse. Saint Martin was on a journey and arrived very weary in the evening at the house of a countryman and asked for lodging. The countryman was pleased but the wife grumbled. The countryman ordered that he should be given a bed to sleep in but the wife did not want it and she gave a sack to her housemaid to give to the pilgrim so that he could sleep in a corner. The servant, moved to compassion, put him in a corner in a tub where there was a little straw. So he placed himself on the straw and the sack was soft enough and so Saint Martin stayed there. In the morning his host wanted to ride and went to his horse but he saw that his horse was sick with pain and he gave up his trip. On going to the house he found the pilgrim who was shaking with cold. He asked the reason and Saint Martin told him all. The man was very disturbed about his wife and was going to rebuke her but the pilgrim comforted him. He told the pilgrim that his horse had pains and took the pilgrim to the stall and asked his name and his country and the pilgrim told him this, that he should take 3 spikes of straw and rub them on the body of the horse and say 'Out of the charity of Saint Martin for the housemaid, kind husband, bitter wife, soft sack and little straw, this sickness will go out of this body.' He said this and the horse at once got up on its feet and the pilgrim immediately vanished. This treasure remains for this good man from the mouth of Saint Martin.<ref id="ref194" n="194" target="en194" type="noteref">194</ref></p></div2>

Save this for your needs. The animal that is sick from worms has boils on the body, first forming on the chest, the neck, the forelegs and under the body and then forming on all the body. If you want to cure the animal rapidly do it this way. Take one of those pimples or boils with 2 fingers and cut it with the tip of a little knife or with a lancet or other tip that cuts well.

When your horse has any galls on the back or abcess in the shoulder, wash the sore well with warm wine in which has been boiled ½ ounce of ground pepper and 2 ounces of salt and wash the sore well. Then put on the above powder and leave it and protect it so the tail does not swat it. This cleans and draws the flesh together. Then when the flesh is nearly drawn together, take some old shoes that have been baked and a little of the powdered agrimony and scabiosa mixed with 3 times as much powder of the old shoes.

When you have made the poultice, spread it very warm on the croup and over the chest and on the shoulders and the joints of the knees. Rub very well against the hair so that it gets on the skin.

Remove all these white granules that you see. When you have removed these well and cleaned it, put in a little ground salt and rub around with a little oil and leave it so. Do not do anything else. If it needs it, do it on both sides. Then put a green twig of a fig tree in the mouth and make it chew that for a while.

With the first blow say, 'Gentle wood,' at the second, 'Gentle limp,' and at the third blow say, 'Gentle weight.' Make the sign of the cross and mount the horse and it will go as if it had no illness. Then you can also say these 3 words with a sign of the cross and the horse will walk. These are, ' <hi rend="italic">Anter panter, panter anter</hi> .' Say a Pater Noster and you will go on your way. This has been tested many times. Do it 3 times in a row and you will have your wish.</p></div2>

Do this test when you pass through any door and you will see the wonderful result, because this has been proved.</p><p type="div3" id="id253378"> <hi rend="bold">Another for the horse that has lost a shoe through travel.</hi> Dismount and move aside and say 3 Pater Noster with 3 Ave Maria for the soul of someone whom you have known who has been executed or died a bad death. In your mind say, 'O [this person], take my horse that has lost a shoe into your care until I may go to a place where he can be shod.' Mount the horse and go your way safely until you find a ferrier. Then have the horse shod and he will have no problem. Then say 3 more Pater Noster for the soul of the person and recommend him to God. If you let your horse go out at night, commend him to this friend and the horse will carry nothing without your knowledge.

It will last for a while and it will be beautiful to see.</p><p>Also take 2 or 3 lb. of verdigris and calcine it. Then wash it once in a pot and the second time distill it and use this to rub on the white hair. It will make the hair become a different green color.

This is a good secret.</p><p type="div3" id="id253417"> <hi rend="bold">Another, a similar secret to make a star on the forehead of a horse.</hi> Take a root of cyclamen and make an opening in the middle and put therein ordinary oil and put it in the hot ashes around a grill and let it cook thoroughly.

In a quarter of an hour the horse will go lame so that it appears that it is very sick. When you want to cure it, remove the horsehairs or cut them and give 2 rubs to the leg and it will soon be cured without impediment and it will go where you wish.</p><p>Another joke similar to this, but I do not believe it unless I test it first. It is said that if one takes the leg of the black beetle that stays under stones and smells bad and binds it in a little piece of linen and puts under the middle of an exit as the horse passes over it, they say that at once the horse is lamed from that piece of linen and will be lame as long as the thing stays there.

Continue with the fire very low until you see the water change color, that is it becomes whitish. Then quickly change to another receptacle and make the collection with all the joints closed up again so that the gases do not escape from any side. I tell you this not just for the second water but for the first and the third, because this matters. This second water has enough turbidity so that it is not good except it makes the face beautiful and all the rest of the body and removes every freckle and other spot and leaves the flesh very white. It does this by the end of 15 days. This water is said to be the whitening for great ladies and princesses with the property of whitening the face and cleansing it of every spot. It is very fragrant with a pleasant odor.</p><p>Note that you should take the first clear and lustrous water and blend this by weight with an equal amount of brandy that has been distilled with the coil at least 4 or 5 times so that it is all spirit and does not have any body in it. This first water, well-incorporated with the brandy, is called 'Honey Balsam.' Put this water in a large flask for 2 whole days, well-closed so that no gases can escape. Then fit on its distilling cap and under that the receptacle with the joint well-sealed, as you know, with cloth and dough. Fit the flask first in the bain marie so that it cannot move and is firm and solid and distill it with a very little fire. I say little, so the water is barely maintained warm.

The Jesuatti were one of the religious groups begun in the late Middle Ages devoted to care of the sick. They were known for the preparation of medicines. The Jesuatti began as followers of Giovanni Colombini (ca 1300-1367), a merchant of Sienna who gave up his business and devoted the rest of his life to good works. Their habit was a white soutan and white four-cornered hood with a dun-colored mantle. The Order was suppressed in 1668 by Clement IX (Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 8, p.458 and Vol. 12, p.239).</p></note><note id="en6" corresp="ref6" n="6" place="end"><p>This remedy is similar to many washes for the eyes used at that time.
