Take marsh mallow, well cooked and well ground with pork lard, and flaxseed flour and well ground fenugreek, the amount of everything at your discretion, and incorporate them on the fire. Put it on the breasts and it will work well for you and the milk will be increased.

Another for one who may have lost milk. Take a hoof of a cow, roast it and make very fine powder and give it to the woman who has lost her milk to drink with wine or warm broth with sugar and soon her milk will return.

Another in whom the milk has been lost. Take some of the herb burdock, grind it and extract the juice and give 2 or 3 ounces to drink warm, with sugar in it, to the woman who has lost her milk and she will have it in abundance.
