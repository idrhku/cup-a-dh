You can preserve the wine for a long time and you can be sure that it will not be spoiled. The sack should be 4 fingers above the bottom and for as many loads of wine, put in that many spoonfuls of this powder and the wine will be preserved securely.

Write these words on the cask and the wine will never spoil, viz. 'Taste and see because sweet Christ is Lord. Blessed is the man who hopes in him.' But it would be better if you wrote the words on an apple or other fruit and put it in the vessel and it will never spoil. This is tested.
