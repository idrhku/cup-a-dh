Take 6 ounces of rose honey, 1 handful of dried hyssop and one nutmeg. First boil the hyssop with the nut in an amphora full of water and boil away a third part of the water. Then strain this water and take again about as much rose honey and boil again. Every morning take one cyathus, warmed.

Most perfect oil for the stomach. Take 1 handful each of fine mint, fine marjoram, young thyme, young basil and sage and the same amount each of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mastic, cubeb, mace, galingale, cardamon and grains of paradise or, in place of them, sweet spices may be taken. Put everything in a pot and cook it on a bain marie.
