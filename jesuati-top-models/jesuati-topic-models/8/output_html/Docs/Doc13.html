Take earthworms, wash them with white wine, and cook them in ordinary old oil. Then press them well and add into this oil some marrow from the front feet of a ram and with wax make an unguent and rub yourself with this and soon the eyes will be cured and will have recovered from being everted.

But note these things that are very harmful to the eyesight, viz.: too much over-eating, too much staying up at night, too much dust, too much writing, crying, smoking, too much drinking wine excessively, luxury, and eating beans, pepper, garlic and onions and many other things.
