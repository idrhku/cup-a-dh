Then place it carefully on a cloth. But first rub the itch or other irritation that you may have with warm rose oil. Then put on this poultice, very warm. Do this several times and soon you will be cured.

Another for a sore developing on the leg or a swollen sore. Take 2 handfuls of the herb nervarola , that is goat's rue, and a bucket of fish bones from the head and boil with the herb until it is reduced 1/3. Then with this boiled liquid, warm, wash the leg and keep the leg in the warm bath not less than an hour and the longer you hold it soaking the sooner it will be cured. Do this bathing at least 2 or 3 times a day and with longer times it will be cured sooner. Dry the leg with a fine cloth...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>put ounces fire unguent powder white ounce made wax rose</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>put cut make place remove rub hair fat tested save</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>ounces boil put ounce honey strain clean pot syrup dram</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>oil warm times put cured cure make rub white boil</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>morning give drink pain powder warm cured fine eat patient</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>water good days sugar make things sleep flowers wine half</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>stomach blood sickness head make dry sick great time makes</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
