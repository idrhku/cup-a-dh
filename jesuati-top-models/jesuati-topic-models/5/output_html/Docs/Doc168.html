Write the psalm, 'Hear my prayer, O God,' and he should carry it on him and she will always love him faithfully.

For a man who does not want to stay with his wife. Take lodestone and white lead and say a mass over them. Then make fine powder of them and give it to him or to her to eat and shortly they will love each other very warmly.

To make a man leave a woman and attend to his wife. Take a bean and divide it and write on one part the name of the one who has the power to be discordant and on the other part the other name and throw them apart and they will dislike each other. Doing this and redoing it will be holy work. Keep faith that it has been tested several times.

Electuary to rewarm the stomach and the kidneys to incite venery.
