holy words so that she hears them viz the heavens tell the glory of god and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands day to day his word comes forth and night to night his wisdom is revealed they are not discourses nor utterances the voices of these may not be heard within the bounds of earth he has placed his tabernacle in the sun come forth as a bridegroom coming from his marriage bed

advised that as soon as she has given birth the stone should be removed because the inside may all come out and this results in great danger if you think that the baby is male tie the stone to the right thigh and if you believe that the baby is feminine the stone should be bound on the left thigh and parturition will be almost without pain if by chance the woman is not able to carry the child to its time and that during this time it may be lost without much cause the woman should carry this stone on her back so that it touches her flesh and she will carry the baby through god s grace to its time then if the stone is removed as she begins to feel the pains make it hang on one of her thighs as described above if the woman may know that she may have too much heat or warmth and this is the reason that she may not carry the baby to its time she should eat almost all things cooling during this time this aids in carrying the baby so it is not detached from the kidneys and stays to the

milk splits apart or spreads on the water smoothly judge that the baby will be female then do the same with the second glass of cool water with milk from the left breast see if the signs are confirmed if the drop goes to the bottom you will say male and if the drop spreads you will say it is female try this other sign if the gravid woman is upright on her feet call her and watch well which foot she puts first before the other if she puts the right foot forward first it is a male in her body and her body will be pointed toward the front if she puts the left foot first judge the baby to be female

it up as finely as the size of beans then put it back in the retort and let it putrefy for days distill it with the retort of the still on ashes and first keep the fire low begin increasing the flames little by little until all has distilled and it will be made then distill it on a hot bath and in this way you will have oil of sulfur and at the bottom of the pot it will be ruby red distill it in the retort with a very hot fire and you will have oil of sulfur like a ruby in all its perfection another way to prepare oil of sulfur take lb of good quality salt and grind it finely and put it in a

need to do this several times because this does not make more than one ounce per pound of sulfur put the vessel in the center of a glass bowl as you see put on its glass cap luted below the thickness of a thumb or a large funnel that receives all the fumes so that nothing is lost then start the fire under the sulfur with a candle the cap should not touch the bowl by the distance of half a finger

flask and also in a little sack of cloth pointed at the bottom put it in a humid place fenced or underground so animals or other bad things or air or wind cannot get to it and it will soon become wet and will yield the oil at the end of to days sooner or later according to whether it is settled in a suitable place to receive humidity easily tie the sack in the air so it does not touch the glass on any side strain it into a glass flask and little by little empty it into a bottle it will be clear and transparent and will look like clear water save this as something dear when it will not give out more oil take the substance that remains in the sack and reboil it in a a pot of water that is with lb of water to lb of this material and boil until it reduces wash all the body with this water and it will remove all itching and all dark or red marks or moles and it will make all your flesh white as it used to be if you will wash the face and chest with it it will make the skin lustrous and clear and stretch out every wrinkle and it will make you appear younger than you are if you add a little dried rock alum in this water and wash out a spot made by wine or ink wherever and whatever it is it will soon be removed and will be seen no more the virtues of the above described oil of tartar first it is useful for removing all marks or the edges of wounds when it is rubbed on warm several times and it even removes all black marks on the body another to remove spots made by ink on any cloth wet the spots and let it stay a little until the oil has penetrated well then wash it with fresh water rubbing it a little and if the spot does not go away at first do it two times and it will disappear be the spot made from ink wine or grease if the spot is on cloth or fabric of silk apply this oil or times but do not rub it and wash with clear water and it will go away another this oil is powerful to brighten the painted figure that is by bathing with a fine clean sponge otherwise with a soft brush put it on the drawing or other painting in the same way as a liquid varnish you should know that this helps brighten all the colors and all the painting seems to be renewed as soon as it is dry this has been tested many times another it is powerful to aid all nerves which have been torn or retracted by any infirmity when it is used very warm it soon helps and cures i have tested this on my own hand twice only the ointment was very cold and i am more than half cured the alchemists use this oil often but they redistill it and make it into a solid then they make whitening and other things this oil has many other virtues that i have not written but by using it you will discover them keep it always near you because the older it is the more power it gains when you want to calcine it do nothing but leave it intact because it calcines better and when it is calcined it is dark and can be made into fine powder when you do it this way and keep to the above rules it will work well for you do these tests and you will agree oil of roman vitriol true and perfect with its virtues take not less than lb of good clean roman vitriol if you take less you may not recover the expense because it yields not more than one ounce of oil per pound or about that grind it finely because it works better then put it in a clean large pot and fill it and push it in as well as you can but do not break the pot put on its cover and lute the cover on the pot so nothing can escape and make it so the seal sticks out about the thickness of a finger let it dry well in the sun then make an oven of bricks walled up with clay in a corner of the fireplace under the flue of the chimney and do it in the way that you see here fit your pot in the middle and close up around it with bricks that are vented only by one little hole behind make a fire of dry wood underneath and burn it very slowly for one whole day that is hours and let it cool then open the oven and draw out your pot be careful before you break the pot in order to remove the vitriol to have first prepared a large bronze mortar and a sieve covered as it is for spices and a large curved retort as you see as before it must be well sealed with lute of wisdom and the neck of the retort hangs out of the oven through an opening first break the pot which otherwise you would not be able to empty because all has been made into a hard mass of red that looks like powdered brick be quick to grind it and sieve it and put it in the retort this is done so that it takes up little air because it is affected greatly by air so that it does not render the oil sufficiently and if the powder was coarsely sifted it renders less oil you are warned about all these things when you have put all this powder in the retort place it in the oven as you see so it lies along the length of the oven the bricks that are used underneath are unbaked and are one finger apart one from the other and all the way around it is walled well with bricks and clay and it has a narrow little opening behind and a small opening in the front at once put the largest receptacle you can find in respect to the great outburst of vapors that comes suddenly at the end if it is small it would be broken from this sudden outburst but it works the way i tell you make the fire in the middle of the oven and be advised that the fire controls everything make the fire very slow and with dry wood if it is not dry do not use it and if possible it should not be one stick each time but at least if you can put them there always stir it up one at a time continually if you see them touching never leave the fire and never let it stop burning and keep it always steady be warned about this because it is very important never leave the fire to burn by itself and at night one must always watch because it must not lack care for days to make it perfect and good with all this care it will never show you a sign except on the fifth day the spirits will begin to come forth and to come out into the receptacle with great force because having closed the opening of the receptacle securely with luted cloth all around the gases cannot escape also it is better if the receptacle is large here is an ingenious secret so that the receptacle may not be broken by the great heat when the gases are entering devise a way that cold water is always dropping on the receptacle and in this way it or any other receptacle will never crack be advised that if you do this dropping of water in or days you will have oil more quickly if you do not do this dropping of water you must wait to the fifth and sixth day and then all the gases will come at once it is a frightening thing to see such dark smoke fill up all the receptacle which then condenses below and soon is reduced to oil this oil is blackish in color or dark tan and take this with the aid of god and with speed and dexterity and extract it from the receptacle and put it in a large glass bottle and secure it because this oil is a very fiery and active spirit keep it covered with great care with new or white wax and with or layers of parchment doubled and well tied because in truth all the spirit may be lost quickly in fumes and be gone at the end i will tell you some of its virtues but first i want to advise you to make this other oil of ruby colored vitriol which is red in color resembling the element of fire it is made in this way as you will learn viz first take some roman vitriol in the form that you have made before and when you have ground it put it in a glass vessel and close it well and put it in warm horse manure in the full sun for to days then remove it and do as you have done at first having prepared the retort sealed with lute grind the mass and sieve it finely and put it in the retort so the air does not hurt it do this quickly and follow the rules above then place it in the oven as you see the retort placed above and with as large a receptacle as can be found seal the joint so it does not leak make the fire at the beginning very lively and draw off the first water from the top be advised that when you see the gases coming quickly change the receptacle and put under another to receive these gases which are converted into reddish oil wrap the joint of the flask so it does not leak using very good plaster because in this consists all the importance of your work do not let the gases escape neither by love nor force make the fire more temperate and gentle always continuing it steady with dry wood and you will see these gases coming as was done at first but not as much because they are issuing from water at the top at first it will be a little less and it will be very reddish red and of the greatest potency more than all other oils it is used in medicine and outside of medicine the philosophers in the works of alchemy call it the green lion and it congeals mercury and has the most potent virtues almost incredible and in all its actions it is wonderfully potent now we will speak of the virtues of the first oil of copper sulfate first described above i say that this oil has so much potency that it consumes everything and it is not burned another if you put iron copper tin lead or wood in this oil in a short time you will see it consumed and converted to vapor except olive wood and ivory these two are not consumed and they are made resistant another if you put a drop on a cape or clothing that was in or or even in folds it consumes all in this way at first you do not see any sign but if you examine the garment all the holes are seen where the fabric was consumed completely another if you put a single drop in the middle of your hand it will pass quickly from one side to the other without pain and you will feel nothing another if you put drops in a glass of sweet wine it will remove the sweetness at once and give it a certain burnt flavor very appetizing to taste it gives you a very good stomach and will make you look younger and with very good breath it clears the eyesight and preserves the memory it removes corns rapidly this has been tested another it is powerful against plague given to drink with water of marigold and with

cloths and wet them in this composition and put them on the sores in the evening and morning and the wounds and sores will be gone quickly this oil is used for drinking in medicine and in surgery it is called the green lion when you want to make it use all your diligence in preparing it grind the roman vitriol finely and place it in the retort and make the fire very temperate and low learn to collect the distillate quickly so that you do not lose the gases which are easily exhaled learn to save it when you change receptacles and to be quick and keep it well covered you have in it a cure that will bring you honor in all the above infirmities it has been tested note that the first oil contains part of the elements of water and of fire but the second which is reddish contains nothing of water because you have removed that first and have left all of the element of fire the major virtue for all things is not in the first oil and you should be aware of this in treating with it in hardening the red oil does not have equal and does its work quickly and effectively this has been shown some say that if the fire is strengthened under the first retort then the element of fire may come out in the first oil that is extracted but the fire would need to be lively i have not tested this and i leave it to you to research more about that i have done all that i have said to you and have given the rules we were companions and we made this oil together oil of talc prepared for a white complexion take lb of talc and ounces each of saltpeter and tartar from white wine made into fine powder put everything in a non vitreous pot making layer on layer of talc and the powder then put on the cover and tie it with iron wire and seal it on very well above and below when it is dry put it to calcine in the furnace for bricks or the oven for calcining when it is cold remove it and grind the talc in a bronze mortar and make fine powder then put it on a marble slab and put it in a humid place where animals and wild beasts are not able to go and let it stand until it is converted to water then distill this water in a glass retort on a slow fire and the oil will come out this will make you esteemed because its virtues are not all obvious but a great treasure is found in this oil men are rare who have such a secret in all the beauties of the body and the hardening to which you put it it will bring you honor oil of talc made mysteriously take not less than lb of talc stone because no more oil than ounce per pound is extracted flake it all finely i think you know what talc is and if you do not know i tell you that it is a white stone shining and lustrous that appears like silver and is hard and cannot be ground but it cleaves into very fine flakes fill a non vitrious pot with these flakes and tie it with iron wire and seal well around and let it dry in the sun then place it in a furnace for bricks or a calcining oven in a secure place where the fire is steady and leave it until the oven is stopped then draw it out and you will find your talc is calcined grind it in a bronze mortar and powder it finely on marble and let sit on this rock or put it in a large bowl or on a glass plate and put it in a safe humid place where neither animals nor dust nor dirt nor wind can harm it it should stay hanging over a bowl to collect the oil and it should stay there at least days once it begins to yield oil it will yield all in about one month if it may not be willing to render the oil put it in a pointed sack of cloth and assemble it with a glass vessel to collect what comes out lower it near the water in a well or at least an arm s length down the well and see that no one removes water there in order not to interfere with the action alternatively make a large hole in the earth in a place where neither air nor sun nor moon beats and place this sack so it does not touch any side and cover the opening with some board and let it stay for the space of to days until the oil is given up to you know that as it begins to give out the humidity it does not stop until nothing more can come out with the first that comes out on the marble you need to do nothing more and you will have oil of talc which will be white and lustrous and appear like silver save this to use for your needs because whoever has this oil will not be a poor person this oil treats all the great lords the illustrious duchess of savoy used no other thing on her body only this oil and she was held to have the most beautiful flesh on earth i do not tell you about solidifying alone because it solidifies and joins at the same time here below we will put some of its approved virtues viz first if you put a drop in purified mercury at once it hardens and precipitates all at once and it stays solid to fire to any test and to the hammer another it is powerful to take away all the marks that are on the body even if the mark is dark or of any color and all marks and scars from wounds another it is powerful to rejuvenate everyone it takes away all the wrinkles and makes the flesh very white and soft another it has power to purify the eyes and maintain vision and it aids and augments the memory another it is useful for the stomach rubbing with this keeps the stomach free from choler and renders the breath good and keeps the teeth always very white in addition it is powerful in giving luster to pearls and coral and to other precious stones it is also powerful for many other things that you will learn as you work with it this is enough for now do not make less than pounds so that you may satisfy the expenditure that you have made and with the honest amount of profit that is customary oil of talc made according to the alchemists take some talc as described above clean and not less than lb flake it into fine particles and let it stay in olive oil for one whole day then touch it to the fire and dry it completely grind it in a bronze mortar then macerate it on porphyry and make very fine powder put it in a glass flask uncovered and boil it for hours on a bain marie and then cover it distill it in a glass retort beginning with a slow fire augment the fire to lively and it will distill oil uusually one puts in some well washed and clean little stones in this way you will have oil of talc extracted by distillation if by chance it does not want to come out put it in a humid place for some days until it will come out in this way you will have an oil which does not lack the virtues described above use it with great care and hold it dear because i have sold an ampule of a quarter of an ounce of it for one scudo of gold and this was for an unknown illness if you have enough of it you will never be poor a man synthetic oil of vitriol that solidifies take lb of roman vitriol and put it in a large pot and cover it well so that gas does not escape and put it in a tub of water so that the water does not enter the pot and with the cover well sealed around so the vitriol does not escape boil the tub of water with the pot in it and boil until all the water is reduced in the boiling tub then let the pot cool before you touch it remove the vitriol from the pot and grind it finely and sift it with a covered sieve so that the air does not affect it and the power is not lost be quick to put it in a glass retort well sealed with strong lute of wisdom and it should be well heated and dried put it on good warm ashes and keep it thus for days then put it in your oven fitted with its receptacle and with the joint well closed with cloth and luted and well wrapped so the fumes do not escape make a moderate fire for days do make sure that drops of fresh water continually fall on the receptacle when the first water comes it comes with some white fumes and when you have these you must change the receptacle quickly and seal it well then on continuing the fire some other spirits or fumes will soon come out which on going to the bottom are soon converted into oily liquid you should know that this red oil and this clear water are called permanent because these are permanent things which cure every serious infirmity as you know from above also the oil has in it very great power to stiffen solidify precipitate and fix the true potable gold is made from this material perfected with purification into the best gold from its ferment of gold it is made from the water described above it is true potable gold that cures lepra ulcer fistula epilepsy and prevents an apoplectic stroke you make it by this simple sequence and the cures are worthy and strong note that on soaking the cinnabar of the philosophers in the fermented oil for days and distilling it through the power of this oil it takes precipitates and fixes the mercury and modifies it into the best gold this secret is rare among men to convert oil of tartar into a liquor take or lb of tartar from white or red wine and put it in a large pot and cover it with its cover and seal it well around so that gases cannot escape and put it to calcine in a kiln or other furnace when it is cool remove it grind it and triturate it on marble then put it in a clean and well washed bladder and tie it well with strong twine and send it half way down in the well so that nothing can hurt it and let it stay for at least days or less and all will be converted into oily liquor it will have properties different from the other in this respect that it does not give off gas and stays more united as a body its powers will be more potent it will give identical effects and has the same virtues as the previous remedy of oil of tartar draw it out of the well and let it distill bringing it forth little by little from the neck of the bladder you will have a liquor from the oil very perfect for every use save it well closed it can remove all the marks made on iron or glass and especially from silver it has many other virtues such as are contained in the chapter above on oil of tartar best and perfect oil made from virgin wax take lb of good new wax that has the odor of honey and cut it into very little pieces then take a good handful of little rocks as large as beans neither more nor less and wash it very well with pure water when it is dried put it with the wax and incorporate well together then put everything in a retort as you see in the diagram very well sealed with lute of wisdom made with trimmings from cloth or other appropriate things to the thickness of a finger and let it dry well then place it on the little tower base with a grid of iron put in between and closed well from above leaving there only its opening to let out smoke put on its receptacle well closed with a cloth sealed around the opening so that nothing can escape from any side then make up the fire from charcoal or from dry wood continuing it slowly for the space of half a day the oil and the wax will come forth into the receptacle and in the retort will stay only the little rocks which are of no value with your ingenuity separate the oil from the wax in the receptacle because the oil stays below and the wax above if you cannot extract it then break the receptacle and remove the oil first from its position and then remove the wax save this oil by itself in a double ampule well closed and it is done oil of virgin wax in all its perfection it has many properties and virtues especially in fistulas i have not seen a good miracle from it and for now i do not say more about it to you note that if you redistill this oil one or additional times it is certain that it is reinforced greatly in its power and becomes perfect this is the way in which oil of turpentine is made with these little stones well washed and with this retort base and receptacle and with all the same rules which you must not vary and you will make oil of turpentine or oil of honey excellent and healing oil of sulfur take lb of urine and put therein lb of quicklime and dissolve it in the urine then put it on the fire until one third has disappeared let it cool and trickle it through felt and save it then take lb of finely powdered yellow sulfur and put thereon lb of this urine and incorporate them well put it in the retort and place it in the oven with its cover and put the receptacle in place and make a slow fire until you draw off half of the water then put it again on the dregs and do this times the third time make the fire very low until you draw off all the water then increase the fire and the oil will come out but change the receptacle after the water and close the opening very well around so that nothing escapes and the most beautiful yellow oil will come out that appears like streaming gold it has many virtues especially against retracted nerves and paralysis and it removes this illness another it heals every fistula from salt humor both old and recent if you will put this oil with oil of pears and oil of egg yolk and extracted ox marrow and mix them in the form of a poultice or unguent and with this unguent rub near the fire or in the sun those with itch sciatica or gout caused by cold you will see the body purged in a wonderful way i swear to you by god that there is not on the earth such a secret remedy like this that hardens mercury into perfect gold i do not wish to declare to you the countless wonderful effects especially on the human body and likewise on the bodies of metals to make clear and beautiful oil of laurel berries take whatever quantity of laurel berries that you have and crush them and put them in a large boiler with enough water boil it very slowly until it reduces more than then remove it from the fire and let it cool collect the fat that is on top of the water and this will be the true oil of laurel berries save this for your needs for which it has many tested and excellent virtues as here in part you will learn first this oil is warm in the third some say in the fourth but i say in the third degree it is very powerful in removing the itch both when given alone and with other oils when the spleen is rubbed repeatedly with this warm oil and with oil of capers it is cured also with oil of lily of camomile and saffron this oil is powerful when it is rubbed on the body of a woman for or evenings to cause the period to start if a man rubs his member and uses it he will feel an effect out of the ordinary it is powerful in many cold infirmities and cures marvelously to make oil of antimony take lb of ground antimony and lb of mercuric sublimate and rub them together carefully and distill them in a retort on ashes with the mouth of the receptacle sealed the distillate will be made in hours it will be just like ice when distilled again in the retort if it is distilled for the third time it will give out water that is clean and pure take ounces of dregs of this antimony and put lb of this water in the retort when it boils a little it will distill out water the color of gold then increase the fire and you will have oil of antimony to make the true and perfect oil of antimony this is a rare secret of the fifth essence god the creator of heaven and earth is my witness that now i wish to reveal to you such a secret that has been revealed to very few men on earth and this is one of the greatest that is on earth this is the way viz first take antimony and powder it as much as is possible and put it in very strong distilled vinegar put it in a vitreous vessel and close it well so that no gases can escape and let it stay thus until you see the vinegar becoming red put this vinegar in another vessel also vitreous and make sure it stays well covered then put more distilled vinegar again on the antimony so that it is well covered as before and let it stay until this vinegar becomes red like the first then put the two together and keep it covered so that its power does not escape and again put other vinegar onto the previous antimony continue in this way until the vinegar takes on all the red color keep on in this way and always cover both so that the odor does not go away when the antimony does not dye more red do not put on more but let the vessel with the antimony in it stay in a place that is warm all the time so the red color comes out of the base then take all this red vinegar that you have nursed from the base of antimony and distill it in a glass still with its cover and its receptacle with a slow fire first will come forth the vinegar converted into water as it was at first then you will see a stupendous miracle that will come miraculously from this blessed antimony red drops will fall like blood which you will collect in a suitable glass vessel and seal it well in this way you will have the quintessence and know that you will have such a thing that all the treasure of the world is not its equal i see this as such a special miracle that its sweetness compares with sugar or honey i tell you most certainly that human intellect is not able to comprehend nor understand nor believe the value of the stupendous power of this thing i tell you especially that aristotle in his book of secrets called this his lead although he did not mention the name of antimony believe me that most certainly never never did nature make such a secret as great as this note well that i tell you every man has been worn out and troubled through wishing to find this quintessence of antimony no one in this world has the littlest knowledge to know how to make it in the way i have taught you i tell you that this secret is above all secrets i am certain that a thousand thousand periods of time would not be sufficient to tell half of the secrets which are in this blessed quintessence that miraculously removes every sore and heals it its virtue is incomprehensible and miraculous when it is made in the above way note then that when the quintessence is made you need to put it in an amphora well closed and put it in manure underground for days so that it stays warm and is putrefied remove it and it will be made and then use it never will you find that this is the lead of the philosophers which is said to be the fifth essence briefly know that it may give color to everything except only mercury praise god for such a secret i do not tell you of its virtues but i advise you that if you put in vinegar distilled from white lead and let it boil for hours the vinegar will be consumed and the white lead remains thick as oil this is called oil of lead this is enough for you oil of antimony made in the distilling flask take antimony from the mine not adulterated as much as you wish and grind it into very minute powder put it in a pot that is well sealed and put on it enough distilled vinegar to cover it to a depth of fingers and put on its cover with the receptacle below and bind well around the joint and let it stay on the warm ashes putrefying for at least days in a row then build up the fire brightly until all this vinegar that you have put on rises out it will come out all yellow and fiery do this process or times that is remove the antimony from the pot and make powder again and do as you did the first time until the vinegar that distills out has no more color but is almost white as when you put it in little by little you will see that the vessel becomes dry when it is covered so it does not give off fumes then the base of antimony is no good any more take the colored vinegar and put it in a large vitreous pot and let it evaporate what stays at the bottom is the good quality and you should make this imbibe oil of tartar or times then put this material on a marble slab and put it in a humid place where it will not be disturbed by anything and let the oil come out and collect this in a receiving bottle well closed and so will be made the true oil of antimony another a similar oil of antimony made by a fantastic method videlicet take a large crucible that can be closed with a narrow opening and put therein lb of antimony from the mine finely ground put in enough strong vinegar so that it is covered one or fingers deep and let it stay covered in a warm place to infuse for hours or more as you wish then put on as a cover another crucible like the first directly above in the opening as you see and make a round opening in the bottom and put on this crucible a retort that has a hole in the bottom that enters into that of the crucible as you see and seal all the crucible and the retort in the way that all is closed as one thing place the first crucible with the material in it into a basin made of copper or clay that has an opening at the bottom so the crucible can be placed almost in the center of the basin then fill the basin with fine ashes and from below or around the basin put some bricks fixed together with clay make the fire there and have all the joints well closed so they do not leak first make the fire very low then increase it little by little until it reaches the melting point and the antimony begins to melt and continue the fire until no more oil distills thus is made oil of antimony perfect and valuable because it must distill at a height as you see and this is the best save it well and carefully for this oil is very beautiful and of great virtue to distill by downward distillation take your retort which should be well sealed and put therein that which you wish to distill downward such as the wood of juniper or cypress or guaiac wood you will be able to extract oil from every wood that is gummy and dry in this way by making the fire from above as you see put the retort in a cauldron or a pot which has an opening at the bottom so that the neck of the retort can pass through and join with the receptacle below as you see when the retort is in the pot with the bottom upward so it seems to come out of the pot and join it with the recipient below as you see fill the pot with finely sieved ashes then place the recipient below as you see and put in this a fine straw or pig bristle to give an exit when the vapor begins to come for it might crack the receptacle wrap the joint well so it will not let out gas from any side and make the fire from above as you see then make a hole in the earth and put in first the receptacle then the pot with the retort fitted in it and make the fire as usual in the earth with dry wood or charcoal very slowly so the retort does not crack seal the receptacle so that it does not break easily as it begins to distill remove the straw so that a little gas escapes which helps keep the receptacle from exploding in this way you can distill everything which may be difficult to distill by other methods through this descending distillation everything will come out for you with this method you will be able to extract oil from juniper wood and cypress wood and from lignum vitae that is guaiac wood to bathe the gummas of syphilis you will also be able to make all kinds of oil that you want this distillation is very effective oil of juniper made in this way take two vitreous clay pots and put one over the other and fill the upper one with finely divided unsoftened juniper wood put a grid between the pots so the wood does not fall into the lower pot both pots should be open so the fumes from them are able to go out they should be placed within the fire box so the charcoal fire extends around the upper pot in the fire box ignite the charcoal and as soon as the wood in the upper pot is heated oil from the upper pot will come down into the lower one in this way you will extract all kinds of oils and they will come out for you it has been proved oil to protect against venoms poisons and worms proven through the holy memory of our lord pope clement vii take the oldest olive oil that you can find because it is more effective and penetrating and for each pound of oil you want or more live scorpions after you catch them save them in a glass vessel with bran and basil leaves they should be caught and this oil should be made under the sign of the lion if possible because at that time they are in the best condition when you have caught them do not hold them for more than or days put the oil to boil in a glass vessel on the bain marie and when it boils put in the scorpions but first stir them up with a little stick to incite them so they will give out their venom at once throw them in the boiling oil and boil them at least hours or more in the bath the vessel where they are boiling should be well covered and closed so that nothing escapes then strain the oil and press the scorpions in the press and extract all the substance that you can and put it with the oil and throw away the dregs then take a large flask not made of thick glass and put them in the strained oil but do not fill the flask so that it cracks from the weight for each pound of this oil take ounce each of theriac mithridatum clay from lemnos and fine rhubarb with everything in powder and ½ ounce each of hepatic aloe lavender and saffron and add dram of troches from tyre if you do not have this and cannot get it use troches from madras all of the above things should be made into fine powder separately if they can be powdered then put them in the flask and cover it well and leave it in the sun for days day and night every day shake it well upside down carefully to have this oil of great value very secure place it in a vessel that holds it so if it fell and the flask was broken the oil would not be lost then when it is made put it in a safe place so when the need arises from which god save us you will always have it to use for you and for others this oil is very good and effective against every kind of venom and it is powerful against poisons and envenomed sores but be very careful that you do not touch the sore or bite with this oil because you will be in danger of causing death but only rub around the sore as you will learn below where i tell you of some of its powers and how it should be used another the method of treating with this oil firstly when one may have been poisoned check to see if it was poison and what sort of poison was taken by mouth at once take some of this oil and rub around the heart the stomach the fontanel of the throat and all the pulses of the head feet and hands continue this for an entire day of hours doing this times in hours and then times in hours and do this for one more day also you ought to rub one who might go to eat in a suspected place first the pulses should be rubbed as said above and then he can go without fear also one who was bitten by any poisonous animal should be rubbed as described above especially around the bite or puncture from the animal also one who is infected or had any carbuncle or swollen gland opened at once he should be rubbed as above times in hours especially around the malady or sore do this until the pain has gone but first blood may be drawn as is the custom for infections also for one who may have to be with infected persons first he is rubbed as above but it is enough to do it times in hours then he will go with certainty without any concern for danger also one who may have eaten fungi or poisonous herbs or whatever thing is poisonous should be rubbed as above times in hours also one who suffers from sickness due to worms of any kind should be rubbed with this oil around the heart and also the wrists the fontanell of the throat the stomach and the nose do this or times and you will cure him soon with the aid of god for brevity i do not add the many other virtues that are contained in this oil but you will learn them by using it another similar oil follows oil similar to that above tested in the time of our lord pope paul iii on prisoners in the tower of savella by monsignor diomede the neapolitan who was responsible for not cutting off their heads instead this is the way to make this oil viz take lb of the oldest olive oil that you can find and put in this oil lb of live scorpions more or less according to what you want to make one lb of oil takes ½ lb of live scorpions bring this oil to a boil on a bain marie in a vessel that has a long neck at least or hands in length and seal it and boil it on a slow fire put the scorpions in a glass vessel and poke them with a little stick so their poison ejects out then put them in the oil and boil them very well until the scorpions are well cooked remove it from the fire and let it cool remove the scorpions and grind them in a mortar return them to the oil in the vessel and again on the bain marie and boil them again for an hour or more let it cool and strain the oil through clean muslin pressing the solids well and extract as much as you can and put it in the oil then put it in a glass vessel close it well and put it in the sun in the clear sky for days in a row and it will be made do not alter the rules given above for making it in a month of great heat because the heat reinforces the power in the oil and gives it the same virtues that the first has also when you want to use it follow the method and rules given above especially when the person may have been poisoned the first thing is to rub around the heart that is the principle problem times in hours do this on the first day on the second day do it times in hours in all these things the first oil is good and the second has the same value as long as you know how to use it in the way described above do it with every care and solicitude so it will succeed well for you special oil against venoms similar to that above and also powerful in illness of the hip take some of the above oil and strain it through clean muslin and put it in a glass pot and heat it on the bain marie then put in the things listed below that is dram each of lavender hepatic aloe myrrh gentian tormentil and white dittany drams of fine rhubarb and drams of fine theriac all these things should be pulverized very finely then let the pot stay well stoppered for hours on the water bath with a very slow fire then draw it forth and put it in the sun in the clear air for not less than days and every day mix it upside down so that the material comes to be incorporated well and the substances there are purified the way you use this oil against poisoning is that you want to rub this oil on the palms of the hands the soles of the feet and along the spine in truth this oil is precious and unique in all of the above infirmities this oil is also powerful in those who have pain in the hips the way you use this remedy is to rub with the oil very warm where the pain is felt and do this several times in many persons it has helped greatly and it has freed them from hip pain this oil was much used by a most reverend cardinal in rome in many serious illnesses he used it warm and treated many worthy and learned men oil of scorpions which saint bernard used against poisons take old olive oil as described above lb more or less according to how much you want to make from scorpions taken in the month of august when the moon is in the sign of the scorpion there should be at least because each ounce of oil requires at least to scorpions put them in a large barber s basin and with a little stick annoy them so they eject out their venom at once put them in a vessel in which the oil is boiling cover it well and boil it on a bain marie for at least hours so that the scorpions have fallen apart then when it is cold strain it through muslin first wet in white wine press that material well because that holds the virtue and it will be made perfect and good put it in a well stoppered glass bottle and let it stay in the sun for at least a month then keep it in a secure place for your needs here we will speak in part of its straight forward virtues first it is powerful against plague rub it on the heart and then around the sores and around the pulses of the head the sternum and on the stomach it should be very warm another it is powerful against poisonous drinks when this oil is drunk and rubbed warm around

healthy anyone who has been cured of the french sickness if by chance he has another illness will be always worse than he would have been if he had not had the french sickness if a man is wounded who was freed of the french sickness and recently was cured yet if a finger is cut by cutting bread that usually would be cured in hours it is not cured in days you understand how harmful is the effect of the disease lotion with a gargle for those who have the french sickness with syrups given before the medicine take ½ ounce each of syrup of juice of fumitory hops and endive and ounce each of water of endive hops and fumitory mix these kinds of syrups with the kinds of waters and this makes one syrup take of these in a row and afterward take the medicine written below viz the medicine take ounce of

on the sick person and it can only benefit him to do this before giving the medicine these are the syrups that the sick person in given to use after he has taken the first medicine they are wanted for those who have the french sickness that is not recent and who are liverish yellow and dropsical and with other problems that the person may have inside use all these items for your cure viz take ounce each of colocynth and round birthwort ounces each of cloves nutmeg long pepper ginger and grains of paradise scruples each of musk and amber ounces of fine sugar and lb of malvasia or good wine break up all these things coarsely and put them in a little linen sack that is clean and pure take a clean little pot or other suitable vessel and put in the malvasia and or lb of cistern water then put in the sack which should be suspended in the middle so that it does not touch the bottom or even the sides of the pot make it boil very slowly with a low fire until it reduces then put in the sugar and after it has reached or boilings remove it from the fire and it will be made the beverage which is worthy and high class when it is cool strain it carefully save it in a glass flask pressing the sack well and save it in a secure place that is cool because the longer it has been made the better it is and it does not spoil see that the patient takes it every morning as the usual syrup at least ounces if he has the kind of sickness that requires following the rule of what ought to be taken then he should wait at least or hours before eating and he should eat only good food delicate and light and this without exception he should not eat things that are harmful nor things sour nor salty and in all things he should be temperate if the sick person finds that he feels better he should continue to take this syrup at least for to days in a row when you have taken a dose you should stay in bed warm at least nearly until lunch then after eating according to the infirmity that you have you can go out of the house to do something easy and keep well covered especially the head and do not stay a long time in the air because this syrup is not a cure for everything that is you should be careful except in the morning and act according to how you feel you should be governed by the seriousness of the sickness that you have and if the legs can hold up to walk note that if the patient has the serious french sickness with great pain and may have taken or or doses of the above syrup one may want to anoint from the waist downward to under the soles of the feet for the space of mornings and not more that is one after the other he should stand before a good fire and then be rubbed with the ointment very warm and then be put in a good bed covered with a blanket but note that if the sickness comes suddenly into the mouth that is in the throat you should treat him at once with this gargle giving it repeatedly for gargling in this way he will be helped quickly to remove the trouble in the throat this is the lotion with which the patient is rubbed first take these things viz take ounces each of oil of camomile rose oil and turpentine ½ ounce of yellow litharge drams of mastic ounce each of white lead and clean wax quicksilver mortified with a grain of salt and ounce of vinegar scruple of rancid butter and egg yolks put all these things in a pot and put in first the oil the wax the turpentine and the butter put the pot on a slow fire to melt and incorporate these things mixing it with a rod then remove the pot from the fire and put therein the other things that have been pulverized finely when it is nearly cold put in the quicksilver first mortified well with the vinegar and salt in a reed tube in a bowl also put in the egg yolks stir well with your rod for a little bit so everything is incorporated together and all is well cooled because the mercury has difficulty being incorporated it tends to separate out so do not lack being careful also the lotion becomes more fine and perfect and has greater power you should rub the patient with the french sickness with this oil or unguent as described above before a good fire begin from the waist and always go downward nearly to the soles of the feet do this for mornings in a row as is said before and then the patient should stay in bed very warm because the sickness may move immediately to the throat first prepare the gargle for a half hour before you do the rubbing the patient should take in the mouth a little rock alum the size of half a chestnut and always roll it around in the mouth and then spit it out and begin to gargle freely when you wish to begin to rub light a good fire and remove the clothing and rub gently downward as the sickness is felt to come in the throat at once remove the alum that was in the mouth and begin the gargle with the decoction written below viz this is of such power and value that it does not allow the sickness in the throat to increase or swell but makes it more

goat fat chicken fat and lard and mix them together and use this to rub until you have made a cure but you need to wear gloves to make the best and true rose honey take lb of water from the spring well or cistern and or lb of clean roses without leaves more or less according to whether you want to make the best or not you will need a tub or a vat either large or small to be able to hold half of the defoliated roses more or less according to your opinion and depending on the amount that you wish to make take the clean water and put it on the fire and when it wants to start boiling do not let it boil but pour it boiling on the roses and you will have a mixture formed into a slab turn the roses upside down for a bit until they all become blanched white then cover the tub or vat or conch that should be in an appropriate cauldron wrapped with wool or linen to keep it warm so that the warmth keeps all the virtue or effectiveness in the water do this again for the second and third morning and this is enough if you want to do it the fourth time you can do it without adding more roses and it will be more odoriferous and more powerful draw out the roses that are soft and press them as firmly as you can with your hands and save these to make odorous water reheat this soft mixture little by little that is the infusion and do not add any more water than the first you should put in all infusions because it increases the strength always reheat well as you did at first and throw on fresh and clean roses in this way you will have made the infusion to use to make rose honey then take lb of the clear infusion without the roses and or lb of honey the correct measure always is part of honey and in this way you will make it perfect and effective it is true that if you put in more honey up to or lb it makes a bigger amount and it will be more to your profit but it will not have then all the medicinal properties to be perfect it needs to have that much of the rose infusion when you have mixed in the honey put the cauldron on the fire and heat it very well and stir with your ladle so it incorporates well together when it is very warm skim it well then you should have prepared your pointed bags at least or or or more partly of linen and partly of wool and they should be fastened as you see above put therein some of this prepared broth and strain it very slowly until it comes out clear put it in again several times so it comes out in clear drops beautiful and clean and looks like a ruby if it will not come out when it cools reheat it again and more if needed until it distills in very clear drops because this filtrate contains all the important material for beauty and also for effectiveness by putting it repeatedly through the sacks the drops will come out clear and beautiful save the foam that you remove when it is on the fire do not throw it away because in the bottom resides much that is also good do not let it boil because it would thicken and not strain easily if it is difficult to strain because of its thickness reheat it again it needs to be warm to filter easily be warned that bees and wasps will be after it actively watch that you keep it in a safe place then put it again in your clean cauldron and make the fire underneath so that it boils very slowly stir well with your ladle so that none sticks to the bottom and takes on the odor of smoke that would not be good it will develop much foam and lift that away very carefully and put it in a sack and so it strains by itself let it boil until it is well cooked but not burned and let it boil slowly do this test on a card let or drops fall and if they stay well joined together and firm and do not slide when the card is tilted then it is cooked at once remove it from the fire and save it warm in a vitreous pottery vessel so that it does not take on the odor of copper in this way you will have made your rose honey good and perfect in every way for beauty and quality note that if you were to make a furnace so you could wall in the cauldron with clay so the flames were not able to get in you would be more certain that you would not take in the smoke or other bad odors when it has been well filtered you should know that when it is cooked it will not form a sediment at the bottom of the vessel as happens with those that are badly filtered be warned of this the effectiveness as a laxative is related to the amount of roses you put in of all of its properties i want to say that for cleaning out the stomach this is the most suitable in any way that you will take it note that if you want to make rose honey quickly because of necessity put the roses to soften for at least hours although usually it should not be less than hours in this method you may be able to make a little of it for a need filter it so it is clear and this is its beauty muccharo and rose laxative effective and perfect take some dew the dew that falls in the night and collect it with a sponge or clean cloth collect it from good herbs that is from burnet saxifrage tarragon endive fennel and cabbage collect it in the good period which is april or may that collected from cabbage works wonderfully to make the body go do not take it from those growing wild in the fields they are not good then take flasks of the dew and put it in a cauldron and heat well until it wants to boil but it should not boil have lb of clean and fresh roses collected in the morning with the dew on them because this dew contains much laxative power if you are not able to collect them each morning as described put the roses out in the air in the evening on a blanket so the dew will fall down on them it will also have a good effect but it is better to gather the roses with the dew on them continue in this way for mornings and in the morning remove those that have been softened in the night and press them very well in the press and add this substance to the infusion then reheat this infusion and put therein the lb of roses described above and cover the tub or vat wherein you put them and put it in a place that stays very warm do this for days in a row and if you do it more times it will be better note that this is called the laxative infusion rose syrup is made from this infusion you will be able to preserve it for a whole year in a vitreous vessel with a little olive oil on top so it stays covered and the air does not contaminate it and make it putrefy then strain this infusion with the sack in which you strained the rose honey and strain it finely so that it comes out clear and lustrous then put in some sugar from saint thomas or madeira that is red the redder it is the more laxative it is and it works better first clean it in this way each lb of red sugar needs one egg white well beaten that is is made all into foam put in lb of well water or some of this infusion is better and put it on a low fire when you see that it has puffed up at the top and wants to begin to boil do not let it boil but at once strain it very slowly through the strainer do not put in the foam but leave it at the bottom of the pot in this way you will have cleaned the sugar note that this is the correct measure take lb of the infusion and lb of the red sugar clarified with egg white as described above put everything together in the clean cauldron put it on the fire and heat it well until it wants to boil but do not let it boil then strain it in the sack described above and make it strain very slowly strain it several times until at last the filtrate comes out clear lustrous beautiful and ruby colored if it is too cold to come out you can reheat it when it is warm it strains easily because it does not have so much viscosity do not touch the sack or it may come out turbid in this way you will make the filtrate clear and beautiful then put it in a clean cauldron to cook on the fire using dry wood make it boil slowly and stir repeatedly for good results let it boil until it reduces or more test it by putting or drops on a card and if this stays firm and does not spread out on the card it is made or you can put a little of the old paragon with the new if it is not now as lustrous and ruby colored that is not important while it is cooking because as it becomes cold it will take on color again note that if one wants to make a good laxative put in drams of purging bindweed and tie it in a cloth and make a little button and tie it with a thread of yarn boil it in and when it is cooked pull it out and throw it away it is not useful any more likewise you can boil in the preparation handful of the herb hedge hyssop which grows in swampy meadows and has a leaf like hyssop and some call it our senna boil it in a little sack and when it is cooked remove it and throw it away as it is of no more good in this you will have made a red sugar laxative the best and perfect remove it at once when it is cooked and put it in a good vitreous clay vessel and keep it in a cool place well covered when you need to make the body go this has no equal the dose is ½ ounces up to but first experiment to see if works or not with that made all of dew then boil in the scammony or the herb hedge hyssop and these things make it very laxative dilute it with ounces of mallow water and give it in the morning at dawn somewhat tepid and afterward one should repose for ½ hour although this is not a medicine for which repose is necessary everyone can take it with confidence note that this laxative is useful in purging every choler and also in any tertian fever and joint pain caused by warm matter it removes all the bad warm and feverish humors from which comes its benefit in the feverish and malign erysipelas in the burning black fever persian anthrax it is given together with diacatholicon and it clears out the remnants of the humors then the patients begin to be better and they trust in the medicine they will not use it if they do not think it is helping when you have given this medicine in one hour give a bowl of chicken or mutton broth to drink with one ounce of red sugar another some make it in this way they take lb of cistern water and lb of roses as above and they make it in the way described above in or mornings then they do not put in the dew but put in the scammony or the herb hedge hyssop it is true that it works but not as well as the dew does it has been shown many times that the dew is more gentle and works very wonderfully keep to the rule given above and you will never fail and you will always get honor for it note that when you want to refresh the laxative syrup take flasks of dew one collected on burnet saxifrage the other collected on cabbage with the whites of eggs purify the red sugar in the way that has been described above if you will do this you will receive honor in every way to make the best effective and perfect julep take the whites of eggs and beat them well with a whisk in a pan until all is converted to foam then put in or lb of well water and not less then put in lb of red sugar or less with red sugar the julep becomes more clear and beautiful break it up with the hand so that it dissolves in the pot then put the pot on the fire and heat it slowly i say very slowly when it begins to swell do not ever touch the foam but leave it alone do not break it or it may become turbid to help it clear up while it is swelling put in a little honey or ounces of water from distilled white vinegar or sprinkle on the juice of one lemon or bitter orange or seeds of sour grapes or as much burnt rock alum as a fava bean or less let the foam rise little by little and when you see that it is all swollen and about to begin to boil do not for anything let it boil but at once remove it from the fire and pour it into pointed sacks made of wool and of felt one in the other pour it very slowly so the foam does not go in but all remains in the pot let it filter so it comes out clear and beautiful if it does not seem clear and lustrous to you put it very slowly through another sack that is thicker and it will filter out more clear and lustrous if by bad luck it does not want to come out do one more clarification only but do not put in any sour things as you have done before because you may make it come out cloudy and then it could be cleared only with great effort and trouble so you will have the filtrate clear and lustrous clean the pot well so it shines and put it again in the pot and reboil very slowly with a low clear fire because with boiling too furiously it wll become turbid when it has boiled a half hour do the test on the card or on your fingernail to see if the drop is firm or not if the drop is firm it is cooked then pour in or ounces of good rose water or otherwise water of violet flowers this is known as rose julep or violet julep then remove it from the fire and pour it into a clay basin clean and polished and without odor until it is cold then put it in your glass ampules covered and keep it in a cool place so it does not spoil when it begins to ferment it is then neither so delicate nor good it will last in the summertime for a month if it is well cooked when the julep is made do not let it cook too long and then this julep is a clear yellow color beautiful to see note that if you make the julep of white sugar you should do the clearing described above and not put in anything except that sugar and pure water when it is finally cooked put in your rose water or water of fresh violets in this way you can make a good and effective julep from all the different sugars this julep is very powerful in cooling and alleviating the great distress of burning heat and fever if you drink it with boiled water or barley water or with fresh water it alleviates the fierce heat of the liver and is good in many other conditions in medicine in addition to this rose sugar effective and beautiful with some of its uses take the buds of red roses before they are completely open and cut away all that white underneath with a scissors so they are clean use ounces of these to lb of sugar cut them finely and grind very minutely then take this pound of white sugar and purify it as you have done for the julep with an egg white and one pound or more of well water and convert the white all into foam then put in the water and break up the sugar with your hand and put it on the fire when it starts to swell do not put in anything let it rise well and as you see that it wants to begin to boil remove it at once from the fire filter it in pointed sacks and filter it well so it comes out clean then put it again in the pot that has been well washed and clean and put it on the fire to cook you will know when it is well cooked by seeing the sign then put in your roses that are well ground and make it boil for a good piece always stirring with your ladle around and up and down so that everything is well incorporated remove it from the fire as it has been made and put it warm in your bottles and cover it until it is cold and put it in the sun for to days when it is very cold stir very well so that it is mixed together and you will have a rose sugar good excellent and perfect odorous and very pleasing if you wish to make it a beautiful red take a little red sandalwood and soak it in water until that is very red when you have filtered the sugar tint it with this water to the color that you want then it is time to put in your roses and when it is cooked it will be a beautiful red odoriferous as the paragon the neopolitan red sugar that is made red in this way note that if you want to make rose sugar from pink roses it is not so beautiful to see but is as good and has the same virtues as this above and also keeps the laxative effect if you will make it in this way take some pink roses gathered with the dew or condensation on them defoliate them and do not cut away anything and be sure they are clean then cut them finely and grind very small take some red sugar a little more than usual and purify it with egg white as you have done above put therein a pound of roses with ½ pounds of sugar close to and when the sugar is well cooked put in the ground roses and boil it for a half hour or more remove the pot from the fire and while it is still warm put it in a bottle and put it in the sun for to days stir up the bottle each day until it will not bubble up any more and it will keep well it has the same properties and virtues as the rose sugar but it is more laxative if you take a half ounce in the evening when you go to sleep and afterward drink ounces of endive water in the morning you will go from the body at least or times without any trouble it has been tested another if you wish to make fresh rose sugar without cooking do it in this way take the rose and if it is red cut away the white completely because this is constipating and bitter if you use the pink take them entire but clean of every other thing cut them well and grind them finely i say well ground because if they are not well ground it remains between the teeth or under them this rose grinds badly and that makes it feel bad but grind them well and the result is refined then put in the sugar weighed and measured as above grind everything together so that it is well mixed then when you have incorporated and ground it well strain it and put it in your clean bottles or pots covered with parchment and make several openings with the point of a knife and put it in the warm sun for at least to days and mix it top to bottom with the ladle or stirring rod so that it will not boil or swell and go out of the bottle this is the way to make it uncooked good and perfect like that above except that it holds more of the odor of the rose and comforts the mind more through its strong odor which is much more pleasing because it is not cooked this has been tested many many times note that if you want to make the conserve of borage that is a confection or electuary of flowers of borage or bugloss or flowers of tamarind or water lilies and violets or french lavender first take these flowers only the flowers pure and clean of every pedicle and cut them as minutely as you can and grind them as well as you can because its delicacy consists of being well ground take ounces of it and lb of sugar always part to parts and grind them well together this is intended for crushed white sugar but if you put in red sugar always put in a little more which is better in every way and it keeps the electuaries always soft and rich then put it in your bottle covered with parchment and make several openings with the point of a knife and put it in the sun for several days each day stir it with your stirring rod especially in the water lily electuary do not fill up the bottle because it swells terribly and stir it often so that it does not overflow the bottle if you wish to cook it hold to the rules given above to purify the sugar with egg white strain it and give it the usual cooking and then put in your flowers which have been well ground and in this way you will make it good and perfect note in part some of the virtues of these electuaries and first of the red sugar taken in the morning it comforts the stomach and the heart and strengthens debilitated intestines drinking it in the summer with water will cool all the body and improve nourishment and also it is a tested remedy for phthisis another the electuaries of borage and bugloss have nearly the same effectiveness they correct much of the impairment of the stomach the heart and the liver because they remove syncope reduce tremor and get rid of every excess heat and help greatly in melancholy another the electuary of violets strikes against the heat of cholera wards off thirst gets rid of the heat of fever relieves the chest and abdomen helps one who suffers from a cough and may be given usefully at the beginning of pleurisy another the electuary of adiantos that is of flowers of tamarind has the same comforting effect and therefore is useful in treating all distresses of the heart another the electuary of flowers of water lily is very effective in removing the heat of venereal disease many other virtues are contained in this electuary that you will learn by working with it simple oxymel effective and good take lb of honey and egg whites well beaten in the pot and made all into foam then put in the honey with lb of well water and put it on a slow fire until it has all foamed up do not touch it and when it begins to boil remove it from the fire and strain it though sacks enough times so that it comes out very clear do not use those sacks to make the julep because it will be turbid wash the pot well and put the filtrate in it again and reboil very slowly until it reaches perfection in cooking and do the test on a card boil it until it reduces almost all the water and when it is close to being cooked put in ounces of very strong white vinegar and let it boil some it will be made when it begins to thicken enough so that it has and holds the odor of the vinegar that it needs to be effective and good this lasts longer than a julep keep it in a clean bottle note some of the virtues of the simple oxymel primarily it breaks up bad humors of various kinds and weakens them especially humors in which phlegm predominates it also breaks up humors in the stomach the joints and the liver in addition mixed with fennel water it is very active against prolonged fevers caused by excessive phlegm it also has other virtues test it and you will see the way simple syrups are made with some of their virtues take the kinds of herbs from which you wish to make syrups such as endive chicory sorrel fumitory mint lavender violet rose and the roots when you make the juice of all these herbs be sure they are fresh clean and well washed and dry and that they do not have dew on them first cut each one by itself into fine pieces then grind them well and put them in a canvas sack and press them well under the press to extract the juice then put it in a pot or in a little cauldron that is clean and polished do this work quickly because the juice cannot sit once made and spoils very quickly therefore put it at once on the fire to cleanse it make the fire low until the foam comes to a head and let it boil very slowly for half an hour then strain it finely in this way make the juices of all the above herbs also all others are made in this way except for some flowers and those herbs that do not have juice but are dry you can save these juices separately and put them in flasks or carafes fill them and put on a little olive oil and that preserves them by keeping out the air which makes them spoil so they are not good keep them in a cool place covered so they are

put therein pounds of the juice of which you want to make the syrup and put in ½ lb of red sugar in little pieces and break it up with a spoon then put it on a low fire until the foam rises to a head and when it begins to want to boil remove it from the fire and strain it in the pointed sacks described above when it is all strained put it again on the fire in the pot that has been cleaned when it wants to boil remove it from the fire and strain it one more time so it will be very clear and lustrous like its essence then put it again in the pot which should be well scrubbed and clean put it on the fire and boil it very slowly and remove the foam with the bottom of the spoon let this boil until it reduces at least of the juice or make the test with the card to see if the drop is firm or not let it cook well because if it does not simmer and you keep it for a long time with aging the sugar becomes candied which is not effective and good then when the syrup is cooked put it in vitreous bottles to keep you should know that to make the syrup each pound of juice of the infusion needs a half pound of sugar and not less follow the rules in the way described above and all will come out

and barley and heat them well and fry them in a pan then reduce them to a poultice and bind it on the swollen area of the vein do this several times and you will be cured of the swelling this is a useful secret another if the vein may have been ulcerated by bleeding take the earthworms that live underground and clean them well with white wine fry them in oil and as warm as you can stand put them on and it will help you greatly also this may be of value in swelling of the nerves nature shows by signs from outside the distress within it appears to me that nature that is man fails in three ways the first way is through odors that is when the odor of something malignant immediately occupies the principal members that is the heart the brain and the liver these are the signs of pestilence that is swelling of the glands in the emuntories of the principal members when the heart is harmed the sign appears in the armpit when the brain is harmed the sign appears in the ears when the liver is harmed it appears in the right rib when the spleen is harmed it is in the left inguinal region in addition some carbuncles come in other parts of the body and these occur when there is greater putrefaction and scorching of the humors in the body when nature is strained too much to draw them out carbuncles appear in the principal members the chest shows the worst effect and this is because it is a sign that the humors are burnt up and putrefied around the region of the heart the second way is by suffocation of the natural warmth caused by humidity and watery putrefaction certainly we see such humidity gathered in our body and especially in the head through which swellings are generated in the throat this illness is called quinsy from which some die sometimes heavy catarrh accumulates from which humans may quickly suffocate sometimes humidity causes deafness and damage in the head with accumulation of fluid in the eyes and great dullness paralysis and epilepsy the third cause is because worms are generated from bad humors through putrefaction they may come to the upper parts of the body and make painful lesions until they make the body come into syncope from which it may not recover if the condition is not helped the person may soon die from the pain and also from the toxic fumes arising from the bad humors that break up and destroy the vital spirits oil of tartar from wine casks made by me friar antonio of spain the man who loses blood by blood letting in order to gain health these things are agreeable for health first good bread of grain well raised with yeast and well cooked a little light wine to drink that does not fill up the stomach eggs fish that come from rocky places and meat of young pig or mutton or other young animals of kid and pullet and the little apples that are found at this time but do not eat cabbages of any sort because they generate poisons in the stomach nor cheese nor anything cooked with it so say galen and hippocrates in aphorisms in the fifth particular it is a very bad thing to give milk to the feverish or to those who are suffering pain on the day that blood is drawn one must not sleep because through sleep a kind of little fever arises that makes the person develop syncope that is depression of the heart or dimness of vision in such a way that in some it causes distress that is swooning this is the value of phlebotomy that is of withdrawing blood you should know that this reduction of blood has all these uses first it makes the mind pure and strong with a good memory sharpens the senses clears up the voice sharpens the vision for one who has runny eyes sets the hearing and the brain in order improves the digestion cleans out the bladder calms stomach ulcers drives out bad blood and saves the good calms the sexual character warms the marrow removes bad humors takes away sleep and administers to a healthy life for a long time whence avicenna said in the fourth of the first principles phlebotomy is the universal evacuation of all the humors he who is sick with fever through too much blood or putrefied blood the blood should be reduced at once at any time ordinarily during the half moon under the sign of gemini when there is transient fever from bad blood the blood is removed from the middle vein and from the vein of the heart in the right arm in the summertime but in the winter from the left another transient fever is one that lasts for the period of one day more or less whoever has transient fever caused by heat or too much fasting withdraw from the cephalic vein of either arm whoever is sick from a transient fever through fasting or coldness watch when one withdraws his blood for he may become frantic withdraw from the vein of the head or the vein in the middle of the forehead whoever has a transient fever through debility withdraw blood from the nose with a pig bristle whoever is sick with a transient fever through worms withdraw blood from the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger in the man who is sick with quinsy withdraw it from the cephalic vein of either arm the man who is sick with transient fever as a result of an abcess withdraw blood from the vein that comes from the little finger whoever is sick with transient fever from pleurisy withdraw it from the vein of the heart in the direct way that is if the pleurisy is on the left side it is withdrawn from the left and if it is on the right it is withdrawn where the pain is that is the right arm in the sick person with intermittent quotidian fever that is which ceases for some space of time blood is withdrawn from the middle vein in the person sick with quotidian through one or the other phlegm it is withdrawn from the vein in the right arm in the summertime and in the winter from the left in the person sick from the salt phlegm with pruritis it is taken out with cuppings on the legs and then cut in the person sick with tertian fever it is withdrawn from the basilic vein that is from the vein of the liver in the right arm in the summertime and in the winter from the left in the one sick with quartan fever it is withdrawn from the salvatella vein of the left hand between the ring finger and the little finger in the person sick with any other acute fever it is withdrawn from the middle vein that is the vein from the heart in the one sick with any dropsy it is withdrawn from the vein of the liver in the right arm in the summer and in the winter from the left in the one sick with icterus it is withdrawn from the basilic vein from either arm either in summer or winter in the one feverish from melancholy insomnia and frenzy it is withdrawn from the vein that is in the middle of the forehead in the one sick through overheating of the liver it is withdrawn from the basilic vein in the right arm in the one sick through defect or impairment of the spleen it is withdrawn from the salvatella vein of the left hand in one sick through defect of the kidney or womb or bladder it is withdrawn from the vein called the saphenous that is the vein that is below the heel on the inside of either foot in one sick through flatulence or bloat it is withdrawn from the vein that is directed to the large toe of either foot in the person sick in the lower parts it is withdrawn from the saphenous vein on the inside of either foot in one sick with sciatica it is withdrawn from the saphenous vein above the foot in the ankle in the one sick with gout it is withdrawn from the saphenous and the basilic veins inside and above either foot the remedy against swelling of the vein after withdrawing blood take equal amounts of rue absinthe and barley beaten together in a warm pan and make a poultice and put it on the vein and soon you will cure it through god s grace another delirium comes from the abcess that grows on the membrane of the brain from agitation of blood or through heat or by one or the other the tympanum is a membrane surrounding the brain and in the ear if it should break the ear will become permanently deaf the remedy for this is to open the vein in the middle of the forehead and it will be cured opening the vein in the middle of the forehead is powerful against abcess of the eyes and against migraine against very grave headache against insanity against delirium and against recent lepra the four kinds of nature sanguine phlegmatic choleric and melancholic the properties of the sanguine nature in his nature he is rich and jesting he is always delighted to hear a new rumor his every concern is in luxury he willingly laughs and keeps himself cheerful he speaks neither gently nor in anger or fury his heart is easily distracted by anything whatever stirs his sanguine humor he is suited to study every mysterious thing he delights in tasting various foods he loves freely and is kind with a very quick and bold manner a red color may spread over all his body with songs and speech he never has enough his limbs are heavily dressed with flesh properties of the phlegmatic nature phlegm is moist and cold like the element water he resembles it being large and stout whatever such a nature does by chance it is with little force lazy and slow he hates to wake up idleness is his great talent he is not astute his desires are crudebecause no one taught him better much of his cleverness is to ignore things his glory his desire his repose these are found in sleep every motion of his body is slow except when he sleeps or dozes his stomach cannot speak but if it spokefor his body it would not be lying properties of the choleric nature if choler is kindled in someoneit makes him impetuous by nature whatever he wants to undertake whatever he desires quicklygrows to great importance to him he has a strong and vigorous spiritfor everything he can be generousbut only if it is not important immense astuteness in cheating othersrules such a nature he gains his strengthby helping himself and spending boldness and irritability mark him he has little flesh and his limbs are slim his complexion is yellow as saffron properties of the melancholy nature the melancholy humor is sadder than any other it makes a man s nature depressed and lowbut very eager to acquire things he is devoted to study and equipped for it sleep in such a humor strengthens his stepand in the evening he may wake up he speaks always of things profoundthat he wants to put into effectand considers everything is a problem more timid than a deer and devious he has plenty of avarice in his breast and envy grows within him his complexion is the color of earth nature has components cold dry warm and humid the elements from which the world is maintained have these components fire is warm and dry air is warm and humid water is cold and humid and earth is cold and dry so are the bodies of persons and of animals that are on earth and from these proceed the humors that is choler is warm and dry phlegm is cold and humid blood is warm and humid melancholia is cold and dry also the year is divided in parts that is spring summer autumn and winter spring is and humid like the blood summer is warm and dry like choler autumn is cold and dry like melancholia winter is cold and humid like phlegm according to philosophy spring begins on february and ends on march summer begins on march and ends on august autumn begins on august and ends on november winter begins on november and ends on february spring has days summer days autumn days and winter days you should know that fire summer and choler are of one and the same consitution water phlegm and winter are of one constitution air blood and spring are of one and the same constitution autumn earth and melancholia are of the same constitution each of these observations in truth confirms the other for the flesh and bone resemble the earth the blood resembles water the respiration the air and heat the fire the digestions of nature note that these are the digestions of nature that turn our food into the human body viz the first digestion is made in the stomach and there the food is cooked in the stomach and the substance of the food is sent to the liver through certain veins that transfer the nourishment the second digestion is made in the liver and the substance that the stomach has sent to the liver is converted into blood that the liver sends by the veins the third digestion is carried out in the veins which are nourishing the limbs the fourth digestion is made in the limbs by the capillary veins the excess of the first digestion is the feces which nature sends to the bowels the excess of the second digestion is the urine which the liver sends to the kidneys then the kidneys distill it to the bladder through pores called the ureters that are hung in the flesh the third excess of the digestion which is made by the veins is the sweat the excess of the fourth part of the digestion is the nails and the hair this is enough for you to know about the secrets of digestion part of knowledge about the urine how to know the urine first know that the things that give color to the urine are the natural warmth of the body and the coldness and the things that give texture to the urine are the humidity of the body and the dryness or the heat the heat gives it the white color and the humidity gives it thickness that is the turbidity the dryness gives it clarity and makes it clear one should examine the urine well outside and in the urinal first you should know well that if the urine is red and very vermillion and thick and not clear this signifies that the blood is too abundant if it is vermillion and clear or yellow it signifies that there is too much heat if it is white and thick and dark in color and more thick than very clear it signifies that there is too much phlegm if it is white and clear and transparent that signifies that there is too much melancholia if it is brown and clear that is transparent that signifies that the blood is overheated through too much heat and there is great debility if it is green and transparent that signifies that there is very great debility of spirit so the blood appears polluted another way to know if any infirmity might be cured or not take the urine of the sick person and put on it a little milk from a woman add it very gently and if the milk goes to the bottom the sick one will die if the milk stays on top he will be cured this is a useful secret another rub the soles of the feet with a little lard and then give the lard to a dog or a mastiff to eat if he eats it willingly soon the sick person will be cured if the dog does not eat it at once consider the person s cure doubtful try this and you will see the proof of it to cure a head quickly that has been broken through a fall or other blow provided that it is not fatal when a person has fallen or has received a blow on the head and the head may be broken but the blow is not fatal do this first make a bandage with egg white and salt and soak a stupe in it and put it on the wound if the blood continues to flow from the wound put on another bandage after adding a little finely ground soot wrap it well and let it stay on not less than hours if the damage is where there is hair clip that first under the bandage when you remove it medicate only with rose oil and threads with a little cloth vz note take warm rose oil and make the tents of fine threads and spot them with rose oil and put this tepid on the wound so it is well covered with the tent rub around the wound with a double layer of cloth and put it over the tent and then put on another dry cloth and bind it with a bandage and let it stay that way treat once or twice a day according to how serious you think the wound is because this rose oil rapidly removes the pain and soothes the sore and also cleans it do this for or days and not more then take some gold unguent and medicate with this first making the tents only of thread and putting this unguent on the wound then put on a bandage with this unguent on it and rub around the wound with warm rose oil continue in this way until it is cured because this unguent makes the flesh grow and when the flesh is ready do not put on another tent but you can put on a cerate of red lead or other primary plaster according to how it seems to you and the wound or break on the head will be cured the patient should take care of himself for to days and not drink wine and stay on a diet of bread and boiled water and with the aid of god soon he will be cured it has been tested

closed then put in lb of the best brandy made from the best wine in a glass still so well that it is without any water then cover the mouth of the bottle well with lute of wisdom so that gases cannot come out put the bottle in the sun or in a warm place agitating and moving the glass with the material inside or times every day continue this for a month and at the end of this time let it sit for days so the matter remains at the bottom of the bottle because the water will have taken all the substance of these things and will be the color of gold empty out the clear water by tilting in this

in the clinic in bologna and in lucca elixir of life to preserve human nature following the method of the clinic in bologna take ounce each of ginger cloves mace nutmeg zedoary galingale long and round pepper juniper berries laurel berries citron rind and melon rind flowers and herb of sage rosemary fine marjoram basil round mint pennyroyal melissa gentian mountain mint bishop s weed aloe wood lavender elder flowers white and vermilion roses wild and cultivated cubebs french lavender cinnamon cardamom ground pine germander mastic sweet flag frankincense grains of paradise male incense hepatic aloe pine nuts theriac sweet almonds pitted dates dried sea grapes dried ripe figs seeds and flowers of dill seeds of wormwood mithridatum and rhubarb and ounces of cleaned white honey then put therein fine sugar twice as much or more than the above things be advised that all the herbs should be cut very finely and not ground and also all the roots the bark the dates and figs all should be cut and not ground the raisins go in whole all the spices should not be ground too finely and also the berries of juniper and laurel all these things should be as fresh as possible and do not let them be gathered too long past the month of may put all these components together and incorporate all in times as much brandy as the above things the brandy should be distilled times into a glass flask and made on a slow fire then put everything together in a large glass flask and the flask should first be well sealed with lute of wisdom put it in the brick oven walled up with clay and with some ashes sifted within put on the condensing cap and a large receptacle below with all the joints sealed with pieces of dough and bound so that nothing can leak out of any crack because that would give forth all its virtue then make a fire below with burning charcoal first make sure that the oven is well closed at the top of the oven heat the oven and the ash very slowly and maintain the fire always so it stays barely warm the components that are in the flask will be distilled very slowly and a very clear and beautiful water will distill out be careful as you see the liquid begin to change color to another liquid that looks like rain water that is not as beautiful clear and lustrous as the first as soon as this change appears change to another receptacle and collect this second distillation save the first one in a glass vessel and keep it well covered the second liquid that comes out is not as perfect as the first and does not have as much virtue except it makes the ladies beautiful the second has the virtue that it removes all freckles and signs of other kinds and makes the skin very white and sweet smelling accordingly this liquid is used by some great ladies and nobility such as princesses and queens this is proof that it is better for this than all other things take the first distillation and weigh it and take again as much brandy in weight as this and this is called the mother balsam then let the oven cool and remove the flask and empty out the contents and with great dexterity put it in a similar flask if you are able to remove the dregs at the bottom without breaking it this will be very good and useful then take the two liquids together and cover them well and it stay thus to decompose with the dregs for whole days then put it on a bain marie in the way that you see in the drawing with its cap and receptacle close the joints well so that nothing escapes as is described above put two large straps under the bottom of the flask so it does not touch the bottom of the water bath and do this with great care make a fire of dry wood very little at a time so that it slowly comes to distill and the liquid will be truly more perfect because in distilling it with a little fire your work becomes more perfect at first the liquid comes out most clear and lustrous with a delicate and comforting odor be warned that as you see the liquid come out with a change in color to rainwater that is of a more gray color at once remove the receptacle with its liquid and at once put under another to receive the second liquid and seal the joints well as before so that no gases escape hold this first water very dear it is more valuable than so much gold and you will be told below of its virtues keep the second water in its place well covered because it matters if it evaporates when you see the cap change to a color that resembles blood change the receptacle one more time but be quick to go from one to the other and seal everything well as said above the first and the second waters have few differences in their virtues the third truly is the color of blood and also place it in a large glass bottle to preserve this treasure because no finer secrets of greater worth and value can be found in this world we will tell some of the virtues of the first second and third waters viz note that the first and the second waters have almost the same virtues but the first is more potent and of that we will tell first if you put a little on a fresh wound it will not need any other medication but it will be healed in hours as long as the wound is

holy herb and brings health in many infirmities the king of india sent seeds to the most holy pope martin as a most unusual gift we have tested the herb and have found virtues in it to distill herbs and flowers or whatever you wish in a bain marie with several decanters and with the philosopher s tower in the first place you need to make an oven that is the philosopher s tower with its cover as you see in the figure first in the design is the height at least arms high more or less according to how it seems to you made of bricks on edge or of paving tiles and mortar made of strong lime with powder of mastic egg white and linseed oil incorporate everything well and make a good and strong plaster that has resistance to fire put the bricks on edge and join them well together one with the other and tight make good plasterwork around the outside well pressed and glazed so the water is not able to pass through also make good plasterwork inside inside the tower at the height of a palm from the bottom put a graticule such as you see it holds the charcoal that is put in the tower and it should be made finely of iron fill up the little tower with charcoal and put on its cover through the opening below begin the fire in the charcoal and this will go on burning little by little and the ashes will drop down through the graticule then around the little tower make a wall of a belt of bricks on end with the best plaster on the inside around the tower there should be an opening at least half an arm s length and the tower should rise at least as much as a palm s width more or less above the container according to how it seems to you plaster the container well both inside and out so that water standing in it cannot pass through either out or in the container must not slip past the ring under the little tower which is made with art and ingenuity and with very good plaster that holds in the fire that sits in the warm water as you see keep in mind when you are making the container around the philosopher s tower that you will have it full of water and that it may also have or or more tubes according to what you want because it can take as many as as long as they can be accomodated around it fill the tower with charcoal from above so that there will not be too much air or the charcoal will burn too fast because there is too much venting below make the fire below with an oil lamp or with a little wood and soon it will be ignited and the ashes will fall down little by little dropping through the graticule and also the hot charcoal bit by bit this fire maintains the water always very hot it will keep it always hot for all the tubs in which the flasks are placed conducted through to them by tubes as you see the tubes stay continually in the water and because of the circulation they always stay very warm by this conduction the water in the tubs is maintained very warm and by that steady warmth the flasks distill all that you put in you will not do better in construction than what is told to you here and in the way that you see here in the drawing also you can add other tubs as many as can go around with the flasks inside and they will all distill with one fire if the tubes continue to carry warm water to the tubs and it distills put in the bottom of the tub one of those tripods as you see with those holes covered around with cloth or tow so that the bottom of the pot or flask sits on it securely without fear of breaking do it in a way that the flask is firm in the water without moving when you see the distillate change remove the receptace first then its cover then remove your flask or pot and with dexterity remove the dregs and put in another that you want then return it as it was at first with its cover on and well closed with the receptacle below with this fire you will be able to make the change times a day and you will draw off a great amount of water this water carries with it the odor and the flavor of the herbs or flowers whatever kinds of flowers or herbs are used you will know by the taste of the water which kind of herb or flower it is this kind of water distilled in this way in the bain marie is much praised over all the other distillations of waters as being very suited to our nature it is praised by doctors and expert physicians because made in this way it does not take on bad odors of any kind because the heat is continually temperate and never fails from the charcoal in the tower as described above the heat is always obtained when it is needed so that in the night it continues to distill and there is no danger that the water will not come out clear and beautiful note that these are distilled in this way roses violets carnations jasmine or other flowers or herbs like basil tamarind or sage or whatever herbs are desired you should know that the water carries with it essence from the things that you have put there if you will do this distillation you will please the laity and especially the excellent and expert physicians who will not carry out so much boiling and decocting it has been found that this will be more pleasing by being more delicate clear and beautiful be careful that the container that is around the tower must be covered so that the heat does not escape or go away and it should always be kept warm so it will distill more rapidly the water should always stay full and equal to the opening of the tubes so the heat can always get out into the container of hot water and it distills readily as you have intended this method of distilling is much used in places that have large and frequent use to distill various kinds of odorous waters in the bain marie first take some tender leaves of laurel and leaves of cedar of lemon of oranges of myrtle and of greater trefoil and

waters and some of their tested virtues first do the distillation that you want of herbs flowers and roots distilled in a lead still as you see in the figure or in a still made of terracotta well fired inside and out that is used often and makes good waters better than the lead still but do not exclude distillation in glass and especially with the bain marie which is unique from all other distillations then there is distillation in the sun which is weak distillation that is used to make some water for the eyes or other such use because we are speaking of distillation in the lead still we put in this figure so that you can see the way it is made and how the stills are placed viz note that when you want to distill herbs make sure that all the herbs are mature that is they have begun to flower collect them after the sun has dried the dew by following this rule all your waters will be preserved well and completely and they will last a long time on the contrary if you take them before they are mature and distill them the waters will not last and soon are spoiled and the water becomes slimy and viscous at that time you need to break it up and filter it or redistill it again

and the rules that are followed to make it perfect and also its virtues first we will speak of the the rules and the way that has to be followed to make this brandy and of the vessel that is suitable for the distillation because if you will do it in the way written below it will carry within itself all the virtues written below because this is an elixir of life to be compared with the best balsam or more in its virtues for the human body if you know how to carry out the distillation you will never be a poor man note down the present method viz the main thing that you have to do make a round vessel of clay as you see before you in the figure not thicker of clay than a thumb with a retaining ring inside that is fingers above the little opening below and the thickness of a thumb and the same depth outward then make a vessel of fine copper to the height of or fingers above the tower that can fit inside it and be well sealed inside because it will be full of warm water the flask will go inside it with its cover under it the lighted lamp is put in the opening with a piece of tile in front to close it this burns night and day when all the above pieces of equipment have been made prepare the wine i say that you should take a red wine not white if you have it if not use the white but dark or red is always better the wine that you want should be good and very fragrant and pure without water the better it is the better the brandy more potent fragrant and odorous therefore take this wine and put it in the flask half full or a little more and seal it well then put it to ferment that is prepare it in this way put it for to days in the center of warm ashes and every day add a little more warmth always agitating the wine moving it upside down do it always carefully so the flask does not break if you do not want to leave it in ashes put it in horse manure and let it stay in a warm place for days because at the end of this time you will distill it the better the wine the more potent it is in everything such as odor taste and its virtue is to be praised then put the flask with wine into the warm copper vessel and put therein tepid water until the vessel is full and the flask fits well and does not move on any side do everything with dexterity then put the cap on the flask and bind around the joint wrapping it with dough and fit it well so that nothing can get out or put other plaster around that is suitable to retain the gases so that none can escape fit its receptacle on securely and lute it well with either dough or clay so the gases are not able to escape then below put the lamp or other suitable light that will have the same effect as the lamp which should be large enough to hold at least one pound of oil and the wick or lighted part should be at least more or less equal in thickness to the little finger as it seems to you put it in the little window so the fire heats the bottom of the copper cauldron so it heats the water well in this way the wine is distilled to make a perfect brandy then put a little tile in front of the opening of the lamp so that it closes but does not block the lamp or it could not burn but the heat stays within this will make the distillation very slow and this is the important rule of distilling brandy because too rapid distillation will not make perfect brandy and the body comes out mixed with the spirit we have studied the separation of the spirit from the body and our studies showed that the distillation should be slow and the lamp should not be removed from below either day or night because it is needed do not run out of oil so your work stays steadily warm and continues to distill when you see the distillation change remove the fire and let it cool well and handle it carefully so that you do not break the equipment note that when you have done the first heating you will have extracted all the spirit and nothing of the spirit remains in the body do the test in this way viz take a little card and wet it in the distilled water from the bain marie that is in the last that has seemed to you not as good as the first that was coming touch it to the fire and the water will burn but the card will remain wet with the second distillation wet the card and touch it to the fire the water will burn and it will leave the card dry if you do this for the third distillation the water will burn and also the card at once this is the sign that it is all spirit and nothing of the body is in it through the long distillation it has become all spirit as you can see then the brandy has become all goodness if you will have it more potent you can distill it or times and it will be perfect and if you continue to distillations it adds little because much is lost but it will be the most perfect and best i say it is the best elixir of life and compares with balsam in its properties note that the first distilled water is good to drink as something simple and pure all those that follow from the other distillations are not good to drink undiluted because they could irritate internally and exhaust a man they are good to bathe only externally and to treat all the infirmities of the human body doing it in the way that will be described in full below of its virtues it is true that little is available of this kind of brandy because it is too expensive troublesome laborious and vexatious to make this is a product for great noble and high class persons who do not care about expense or labor and want it to be made and it costs what it is worth this is enough to have said about this brandy which is made from the most perfect wine in the bain marie and is not as other brandies usually made of putrid wine that the grocers sell at the end of this chapter how to make brandy from poor wine will be described the brandy described above is made only by our reverend priors of the jesuati friars i say it is greatly superior and perfect because they use great care in extracting only the substance so for drinking it has no equal it is pure and without fault note that when you need to change the flasks always have one or flasks ready with wine that has been fermented or distilled so that as soon as you have removed one flask from the fire you have another prepared and immediately put it in the water bath and put in warm water so that it is soon heated hot with the lamp in this way you will make your distillation quick and good throw away that remaining in the flask for you have removed the substance of it and it is of no more value it is called the first distillation but do not throw away that remaining in the flask after the second third and fourth or later distillations these are good to put in a little bottle with vinegar because that makes the vinegar strong and potent and therefore do not throw it away also the remains of the wine are used especially for dying stamped leathers or cordovans when the wine is dark to begin the virtues of this brandy or burning water daily use of the first second and third distillations is approved by many persons the first distillation will burn but its fire does not consume or burn cloth but leaves it damp and wet the second distillation will burn and does not consume cloth but leaves it dry and arid the third distillation will burn and the cloth will be consumed entirely the fourth distillation is very potent and strong the more times the wine is distilled the stronger and more potent it will be so the seventh distillation will consume everything to which it is applied the virtue of the first distillation is that if you wash the face and nose three times and you put a little in the nose it clears the passages and soothes the brain it clears the sight and strengthens retracted nerves washing the exterior of the head improves memory and all the qualities of the spirit if you put in any kind of spices that you would like either the flowers or the herbs chopped up in hours or more the brandy will draw out all the virtue and substance of the spices you can give the clergy at table a wine spiced with cloves and sage and similar fragrances when you have made up this water put or drops in a glass of wine and it will give the taste of that which you have put in and it will keep its odor it improves the appetite and soothes the stomach when taken in the morning and evening it removes the phlegm that is in the opening of the stomach and removes the bad gas that comes either in the stomach or in the head when it is taken twice a day with a small quantity of wine it soon restores the stomach there is no cold venom that it cannot draw out such as terrestrial spider serpent fly or scorpion if one puts a cloth wet in this water on the serpent or similar poisonous animal it is dead at once even if it does not touch them and does the same for any other cold venom washing the bite of the spider or the serpent several times with this water may cure it and drinking some with wine it has power like the balsams and the greater theriac if ringworm or scabies is washed twice a day it will remove it put a little lye in the water and let it stay for a day and a night and then put or drops in the ear and any noise that often comes goes away at once if you put an amount of germander in this water equal to the weight of the water or alternatively as much human blood and let everything stay together for a day and a night and then put or drops in a deaf ear and do this or times and the ear will be freed from deafness from whatever cause this cure is made with the dry herb this water cures every toothache that comes from cold humors it is true that washing the teeth with it kills the worms and the humors that hide in the root of the teeth it relieves the distress of paralysis and every infirmity of the nerves by washing with it this water penetrates so well that when a drop is put in the center of the hand at once and without any harm it will penetrate into the hand it cures swelling of the feet legs and joints and reduces any infirmity that comes from cold phlegm or infected blood as long as it is used in the way described above note that this water always stays clear i say very clear and it is excellent in every degree and in my judgment the most excellent that can be found the properties written above and those written below are properties and virtues of brandy or burning water which have all been tested viz first it cures all the aches which afflict our body i say if such afflictions are caused by cold humors if the distress is internal give the patient an amount to drink that will fill the shell of hazelnut mixed in a glass of good white wine if the distress is external rub with this water mixed with wine as described in the morning drink or drops mixed with white wine on an empty stomach and do not exceed this measure or it will make the man too merry also it cures bad breath that is the fetid odor that comes from the stomach also it cures the falling sickness when it is drunk as described above and is rubbed on the head another it is very powerful against the paralysis with tremor of the limbs by drinking it and rubbing it in the above way also if the infirm person holds a little cloth wet with this water on his tongue it improves and gives back speech note that it does not have any effect on the natural infirmity except once in a while another putting some of this water in grape must clears it up at once and makes it beautiful and clear another it is powerful against the sickness of stone when that is caused by cold humors whether the stone is in the kidney or the bladder if the water is drunk as described above another it is powerful against pain in the testicles that is caused by cold humors note that this water is of kinds that is simple and mixed simple is when it is not mixed with other things and must work alone that is without wine or water to drink this is the most inestimable of all medicines the mother and the lady which has marvelous effects against all the cold sufferings in conclusion this water cures all distress from cold as long as a man knows how to use its powers because when it is brought near the fire it immediately burns this is the measure and amount when you want to use it take one dram up to more or less according to the patient s need another it is powerful against headache even if it be long standing it cleans the head of dandruff it cures all the sores of scabies when the head is washed each day with this water it gives great aid to the memory it is powerful in that illness that people call lunacy when it is drunk as described and when the head is rubbed and it is smelled with the nose if you will dissolve a little fine theriac in this water and take it in the morning on an empty stomach or or more times it will cure you completely and well another it is very powerful in the sickness of palsy when administered as described above washing with it heals the face and the limbs it is powerful against paralysis of the tongue when it is drunk in the described way put on a wet cloth as described above and do it as many times as needed for health and you will be healed

excellence putting in a little of the best that you have will soon restore their condition its effects on the outside of the human body are even greater because it immediately heats whatever place is bathed with this water also all of these things that are written above are true if the water is made in the way written above up to the tenth distillation these are all approved for this water and for the philosophers oil as it is written in the book of the greatest masters we return to the virtues of the above described brandy or the burning water when this water is distilled in the way above you will see a very clear white and noble water with not a few virtues but you should know that the first water distilled from the first vapor is very lively and much more precious than the subsequent ones and is better in every good way if the distillation is repeated many times it will be more powerful the more times you distill it the more you will lose because some consumed by evaporation that is to say from a large container or a barrel of wine the first distillation extracts only a fourth or fifth part it is very true that the power is increased by repeated distillations as the philosophers say who were the first inventors to find the method and the rules to make it in the way described above the first doctrine was obtained as a revelation from the angel called raphael that is the healer from god whose water works many marvels you should know that of ten measures that you distill it is usual to get out a tenth part or a little more it is true that if the wine is very strong and lively and is distilled in the way described above it will be twice that or a fifth part and that would be a good amount from the first distillation of the wine then if you distill a second time for every measures you put in to distill you will get out one measure or half the amount you put in to distill if you distill one more time the part that you have extracted in the second distillation and distill it well a third time from measures you will get out if you distill the fourth time in good form you will extract the same amount that you put in the still or a little less if you want to come to peak perfection you will distill the fifth sixth or seventh time and time after time you will drop in amount as you change from one vessel to the other in the distillation in the seventh distillation the water is called perfect because it does things that are very wonderful and worthwhile the tenth distillation that little which is gathered is called most perfect because it ennobles and cleanses all things first because of the great effort and expense for ordinary medication when the brandy made in the way described the dose is one dram up to two or more according to the state of the patient another it is so powerful that if fur hair linen or wool cloth are rubbed with it and brought near to the fire or to a burning candle the wet thing bursts into flame without being consumed and this happens to any other material it is a marvelous thing that the water burns and not the thing bathed in this water using this water keeps gray hair in abeyance another if the egg of a hen is put in this water it is soon cooked and the yolk of an egg put in the water is immediately hardened another if herbs or other such things are placed in this water if such a water is wanted it will take on the odor of the things placed in it another putting a little of this water in a cask of red or white wine that is weak makes it become much more lively than it was at first and increases its potency for this reason the taverns that is the hosts may gain by buying wine of little strength and making it strong lively and potent with this water another if the wine in a bottle has a bad taste or is spoiled put in a little of this brandy at your discretion then beat it well with a stick so that it foams and you will repair the wine and remove any problem in a way so that it can be sold as good another if by chance there is one who has taken in any way a cold venom such as that of the scorpion or other animal this brandy removes the poison by its fire and heat and removes the bad effects of the coldness and cures the poisoned man another if one drinks a little of this brandy it at once strengthens all the limbs and makes them very vigorous it cheers up the person and enlivens the heart and results in good breath another if one has cold in the head or in the stomach and suffers from a violent or occasional discharge from the head and has phlegm or melancholy drinking a little at a time and repeatedly cleans the head and the eyes and the stomach expands the chest and removes the humid cough rewarms the body and cleanses it of phlegm and of any other coldness by which it invigorates all the sick places of the body and rewarms all the cold another drinking a little of this brandy restores every element of the body external and internal and improves the memory when one drinks and smells it the memory is well preserved another drinking some and putting it on the eyes dispels dries up and removes cloudiness and spots and cataract and haze and all other defects of the eyes externally and transforms all the described defects to good condition it heals all the pains in the eyes internally as well as externally and heals supports and bestows the power of seeing and gives back health when it is drunk and used to bathe the eyes and especially when the distress has been caused by cold also it dries up tears when the eye is rinsed out and a drop is put in the corner of the eye it will dry the eye and support it and remove the tears if the eyelids may be everted it corrects that and reduces the irritation of the eyes another it is very powerful in mitigating toothache if that is caused by phlegmatic humor or if any worm developed there one should know that the upper teeth are cured by way of the brain and the lower teeth are cured by way of the stomach in a short time it will cure and will support the gums another this brandy is powerful to relax all contracted limbs and it supports and heals them whether it is the feet or hands and even the movements of the tongue another it heals canker and the fistula which is called noli me tangere and similar infirmities and problems another it is powerful in every illness of the raging gout caused by cold humor another it cures quartan malaria when it is drunk repeatedly on the day of the fever a half hour before the onset another it cures chronic and stubborn scabies when

salted and use enough cumin the amount is half a glass or less each time and do not drink other water or broth another it cures the vitiated womb of the woman and strengthens it it heals and consolidates putrid and non putrid wounds well another if you will put raw or cooked meat in this brandy and likewise raw or cooked fish they will never be spoiled and will be preserved well beyond the things already mentioned through the grace of our lord jesus christ it offers many other things useful for human nature note that the first distillation is good and the second better and the third is the best if you wish to make the test take a chicken plucked and cleaned inside and scalded so hot that it hurts the hand then wet it well with this brandy that is warm inside and out or times then leave it in the sun for or hours and it will be preserved for years and never be spoiled you can do the same with any other thing that is soon spoiled and it will always be preserved and good to distill wine to make brandy for drinking and bathing with some of its tested virtues to distill every kind of wine good or bad and to make brandy of one two three or more distillations according to what you want to do you need the instruments that you see first you make a pot of copper in pieces well soldered and joined together and well fastened and well welded with very good tin inside and out if that can be done this pot is in the form that you see with a tube well fastened together and soldered inside and out so that no gases can escape place the tube in the part above to put in wine or brandy and another length that comes out of the oven in the part below which serves to draw out the wine that is at the bottom and also the water when there is no more spirit in it close this from above very well and firmly so you are able to overcome the danger that boiling or other obstacles may cause because all the material that is within may come out with force so make a good stopper of tow from above so that no drops or material can cause the problem wall the pot inside the oven as shown here so that the tube is clear make it fit in a way that it holds the heat well and make a space below to place the fire with its chimney in front and with a little opening behind to give it a little vent for a flow of air when it begins to boil make the fire low that is to say two sticks in a cross so that the distillation is very slow then make a coil or twist of copper or of lead but it is better of copper soldered with silver in the way that you see so its mouth receives that of the cap it should be well fastened with cloth and strong plaster that does not fear heat or water and so it cannot ever leak air because all the good gas may be lost be advised that above that place you should make drops of cold water fall because that greatly aids in recovering the spirits that are coming out in that place and they are quickly condensed the water in the box is not warmed much because the spirits come out more easily and without difficulty then you fit the coil in a box or other container to hold water the coil should be under water and the water always cold the gases should be transformed in the part below the water because the coil above the water always stays warmer than that below the gases are converted by the cold to a liquid which issues from the end of the coil out of the box see that the connection there is well closed with plaster and plugged so that the water does not get in in this way the brandy will come out and put a flask or receptacle to collect the distilled brandy keep it well covered with a cloth so that the odor does not evaporate because that is the great virtue of its substance note that you can make a belt of lead in a spiral or snail in the way that you see here in the figure with to turns and about the thickness of a thumb it is provided with rods that hold it in place well tied so that it will always be firm and soldered to hold it right as you see put this in a large vat or in a half barrel which should always be full and cold the end of the coil extends out of the vat in a suitable way so that with good plaster and tow the water cannot exit use either of these two whichever is turned more easily for you because both work and have the same effect also if either kind of spiral is made so there are turns either lead or copper is very good and useful but be careful that the spiral does not have some fissure that would do harm because the water could enter and will do you no good and all the work will be gone for that boiling save the distilled brandy as described above in a vessel or cask that is well sealed you can distill it the second time whenever you want because in this form it will last for a year it is better preserved in one boiling than in two it is not possible to keep the second boiling a long time because much of the delicacy will be lost and it will never be as good at the end as it was at first when you put the wine in the pot always make the pot more than half full but not too much more so in the first boiling the wine does not jump up in the cap and that distilling will not be good after the first boiling reduce the fire a little each time as is said above and keep it maintained so that it never fails when you want to change the wine remove the fire from below so that there is no obstacle for the pot as you distill the wine take a measure of the brandy that is coming from the distillation and when it seems to you that the taste is not as good and it does not have the odor of brandy throw it out for it is not good any more when you do the second distillation use the same test and furthermore drop a little on your arm if it does not sting there is no more spirit in it and if you see that it burns let it stay longer when it has no more spirit remove it from the fire and throw it away and put the other in little by little until you finish the work you have begun it is very true that the dregs of wine have uses they tan leather to make a dark color the base of the second distillation and the third are used to put in bottles of vinegar because they reinforce the vinegar marvelously and maintain it note that the first brandy that comes from the second distillation is always stronger and more potent than all the others that come out and you are advised to keep it always separate again i remind you to keep it closed all the time with wax and covered with good parchment so that nothing can evaporate for if the odor leaves it has no more power note that if you distill from good great and aromatic red wine it will make lively and aromatic brandy if you make it from bad spoiled and turbid wine as long as the bad is not strong and if the wine itself was good and aromatic before it went bad it will make good brandy lively and aromatic when distilled in the way described if you follow this method you will get good results note that the first water is much used with ground spices added and mixed with the second water but it is not worth anything to drink if the second distillation is drunk it results in many good cures the applications of which you will learn below with its weights measures tests and quality that expert philosophers have discovered and have put to use as medicine to treat many kinds of erythema and this has been published in many volumes below we will tell of its virtues weights and carats and how valuable it is for the human body note the strengths of the brandy described above the first thing is to recognize and know if it is good to drink or not when you have made the second distillation wet a little parchment and touch it to the fire if the parchment remains wet afterward this brandy is good to drink and it is from to carats this applies from the first that issues out to the last if you wet the parchment in the brandy from the third distillation the brandy all burns and leaves the parchment dry such brandy is not good to drink because it has reached from up to carats beginning with the first brandy that comes out of this third boiling until the last drop this is known as the fiery brandy which is not good to drink because drinking this brandy unlike that from the second distillation burns the liver and the interior and dries up the blood so very soon it will make you die
