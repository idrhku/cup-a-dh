If you want to preserve wine all year, take a piece of elm wood, long and thick, and enter it from above so it goes nearly to the bottom, within 4 fingers. Tie it from above and let it stay this way continually. If you put in 2 sticks of myrrh and of incense, this wine will be preserved all year and will not take on any bad taste if you leave them in.
