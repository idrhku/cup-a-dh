Another enema for pain in the side. Take one glass each of oil of camomile, of dill and of laurel and urine of a healthy man and make an enema of it in the usual way. When this pain comes from not being able to urinate, take one dram each of the red seeds of the winter cherry, well ground, and ground seeds from cherry stones and mix this powder with good white wine. Heat it and give it to the patient to drink once and then again, one after the other, and soon it will cause a lot of urine and the pain in the side will soon cease and go away at once because you will have urinated. This is a tested secret.

Another for sickness in the side. Take 2 or 3 white onions and cut them crosswise and wet them with camomile oil and rose oil and let them cook well on the grill. Then grind them and put in 2 ounces of strong yellow spices and incorporate very well. Then put these very warm on a cloth in the form of a poultice and put it on the painful place on the side, 2 or 3 times, one after the other. At the end of 2 or 3 hours the pain will lift with the urge to urinate and you should feel somewhat better. Also you can take 3 or 4 white onions and cut them finely and boil them in a clean little pot with some of the above-described oil and let them cook well. Then grind them in a mortar and put on the above spice. Do as you have done above. Put it on your painful spot as warm as you can stand it and it will relieve it shortly and soon you will urinate and be healed. It is a thing tested and most true.
