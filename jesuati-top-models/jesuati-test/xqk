Take 2 handfuls of fresh long birthwort and 1 handful of fresh round birthwort and boil them a little in wine. Remove them and cut them finely and boil them in Â½ barrel of wine that is good by itself but not sweet and it should be white. Boil this on a slow fire until it foams well and reduces almost 2/3. Then strain it carefully with linen cloth. Be careful that it does not touch copper and save it in a glass bottle or other delicate bottle. Drink 2 ounces of this in the evening when you go to sleep and 3 ounces when you get up in the morning. Continue this for 2 months so the cold of the ulcer will come out. Watch how you take care of yourself. Do not eat fat meat nor beef, nor cheese, nor other adverse things. On the wound or on the sore, put some powder made of roots of round birthwort or blow some of the above powder into the sore. In a few days the fistula will be healed as long as it has not become deep-rooted in the bone. You should know that birthwort is warm and dry in the second degree so it has the virtue of growing flesh in a ulcer and also cleans it.

Wine against cold gout.

Take some turbith, the amount at your discretion, and put it with good white wine in a pot and let it stay in the sun continuously for 3 days, well-covered. Each day turn it upside down. Give 1 or 2 ounces of it to drink in the early morning, according to the strength of the patient. When you give it to him to drink, put in a little powdered sugar. By continuing this drinking he will soon be cured. Also this wine can be used to clean the blood and to stop blood flowing from the body. In any similar infirmity put into this wine things appropriate for the infirmity.
