Take fine mint, hyssop, corn poppy that is red poppy, each the same amount, and make fine powder of them and save it for your needs. When you want to use it take one ounce or an ounce and a half of this powder and put therein 3 scruples of ground saffron and incorporate everything together. Then give it to the sick one in a fresh egg. She should take it early in the morning and should stay in repose one hour or more. But in the evening, rub all the body with 1/2 ounce each of oil of camomile and of white lily, 1 ounce of oil of berries and 10 threads of saffron. Make it very warm and rub the body and wrap on a warm cloth and she should stay warm. In the morning she should take an egg as described above and soon it will make her contented and without pain. If this does not work the first time, do it again the following evening and you will have the desired result.
