I implore you, womb of sorrow, by the 9 levels of angels and by the 12 apostles and by the thousand martyrs and confessors and also the virgins and by the four rivers of Paradise, Phison, Tigris, Euphrates and the River Jordan, that flow from Eden. I swear to you by the blessed Mary for health to make your servant well who is not able to continue.
