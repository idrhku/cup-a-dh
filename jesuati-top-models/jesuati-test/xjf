Take 1 ounce of litharge, 1 ½ ounces of fresh white lead, one quatrino of male incense, 1 ½ drams of rock alum, 1 lb. of pork lard, 4 drams of the best turpentine, 1 dram of hard pine pitch and 3 ounces of clean wax. First cut up the lard and strain it. Then return it to the fire and put in the rock alum and dissolve it and put therein the turpentine, the pitch and the wax. Wait a little and put in the litharge, white lead and incense. Let this boil very slowly on a slow fire, stirring continuously so that it does not stick or burn. Then remove it from the fire and have ready a thin pointed sack and put it in so that it will strain out and with 2 sticks take the little bag and move your hands from here to there. Squeeze and pull downward and in this fashion you will make it come out by force. Do this quickly. When it has been pressed out, stir with your rod until it becomes cold and it will be made. Save it in a glass bottle and keep it in a cool place. It will keep for a long time and use it for your needs.
