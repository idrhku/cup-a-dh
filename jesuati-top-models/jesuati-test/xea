Another to restrain diarrhea rapidly. Take 1 ounce of powdered dragon's blood gum and put it in strong vinegar with plantain seeds and the whites of 2 eggs. Make it into a plaster and put it on the kidney and on the pubic region and it restrains the flux.

Another, an ointment to rub the body to restrain the flux. Take 1 dram each of rose oil, myrtle oil, quince oil and mastic oil, 1 scruple each of white and red sandalwood and stems of giant reed, Â½ scruple of camphor and enough white wax to make an unguent on a slow fire. Then rub the body with it and soon the flux will be restrained.
