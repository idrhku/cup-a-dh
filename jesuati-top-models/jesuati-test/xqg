First take a flask or a urinal, that is better, and make it half full of wine but not more. It should be good, great and potent red wine, by nature pure and without added water. Cover the urinal with 2 leaves of parchment for writing and it should be doubled into 4 and well tied at the top with fine twine, as you see. Fit it directly in the center of a pot and fill the pot with ashes that have been finely and carefully sieved and with your hand arrange the ashes around the urinal with dexterity so that it is not broken and fill the pot.
