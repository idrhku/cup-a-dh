Another. If you wish to make fresh rose sugar without cooking, do it in this way. Take the rose and if it is red, cut away the white completely because this is constipating and bitter. If you use the pink, take them entire but clean of every other thing. Cut them well and grind them finely, I say well ground because if they are not well ground, it remains between the teeth or under them. This rose grinds badly and that makes it feel bad, but grind them well and the result is refined. Then put in the sugar, weighed and measured as above. Grind everything together so that it is well mixed. Then when you have incorporated and ground it well, strain it and put it in your clean bottles or pots, covered with parchment, and make several openings with the point of a knife and put it in the warm sun for at least 20 to 30 days and mix it top to bottom with the ladle or stirring rod so that it will not boil or swell and go out of the bottle. This is the way to make it uncooked, good and perfect like that above except that it holds more of the odor of the rose and comforts the mind more through its strong odor which is much more pleasing because it is not cooked. This has been tested many, many times.
