Grind everything together coarsely and boil it thoroughly in ordinary water. Take Â½ ounce of sugar and 2 ounces each of verdigris and zinc carbonate and boil everything in a carafe of good wine until it reduces down the neck of the carafe.

To restrain a snake and make it stay quiet.

First make the sign of the holy cross. Then say as follows, ' Os, os, osia. Stop, you most worthless serpent, by the power of these holy names of God, + Tettagramaton , Lord Jesus Christ, and by the milk of his mother, the most blessed Virgin Mary, because you are subdued and constrained by me as the dew is by the sun. As you will go away from fire, so you cannot harm me nor any Christian and your venom is lost, in the name of the Father +, Son + and Holy Spirit and in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, Amen.' Then say this, 'Like the water of the River Jordan, when Saint John the Baptist baptised our Lord, Jesus Christ, so I charm you serpent by the true and living God, by the holy God, by the God who expelled you from paradise. So in this world I believe that you cannot do harm to me nor to any other person, nor to any Christian creature. He will walk on the asp and the basilisk and will trample underfoot the lion and the dragon and put out your venom. I touch you and will touch you and restrain you with my right foot.' Then say 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Marie and let the serpent go with confidence that, in the name of God, of the Virgin Mary and of Saint Paul, he will not hurt you in any way. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.

*Perfect water to cure every illness of the leg.
