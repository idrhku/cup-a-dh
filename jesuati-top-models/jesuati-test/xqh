Then fit the pot on 4 bricks so that there is a space of at least 4 fingers below. Put under this some warm ashes and lighted charcoal so that it heats the pot with the ashes and then the wine will heat and it will distill. When you have arranged it as it should be, put the cap on the parchment. Take a cloth, wet it with clay or with soft dough, and put it around the joint of the cap and wrap it well so nothing can escape from any side. Then put the receptacle underneath the cap and put more plaster around that joint so nothing can escape from any side and arrange it in the way that you see.

By keeping to the rule described above and with a little fire, the water will distill properly and well because first the pot is heated, then the ashes heat the urinal, the wine vaporizes and hits on the parchment and moistens it and the urinal heats the cap and that draws the moisture out from the parchment and distills it into the receptacle. This makes very good brandy that is good to drink. However, it is not the best but it is enough to have seen the way and the rule as it is done to make the brandy described above. This is the amount that you will get out, 4 or 5 ounces of brandy per jug of wine and that will be sufficient if the wine was good, as was said above. In this way you will have achieved your purpose and this is enough.

Sage wine for contracted nerves and for lunacy and it is very powerful in paralysis.
