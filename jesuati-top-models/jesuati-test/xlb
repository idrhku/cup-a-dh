Take 2 scruples each of rose oil, white lead, turpentine, clean wax and lard from a male pig and put everything together in a pan or pot, the oil, turpentine and wax, and as they melt put therein the lard and continue stirring. Lastly put in the white lead and when you see it increase in height, put in one cloth at a time, always stirring top to bottom so that everything becomes incorporated well. Then put in the others until all the material is used up and the pieces of cloth become dry. If you wish to make less, put in less cloth. You will have made a bandage to cure the leg.

For problems with the knee or other illnesses of the leg.

Take 3 lb. of ordinary oil, 1 lb. each of yellow litharge and clean wax, 3 ounces of red lead and 4 ounces of white lead and incorporate everything on a slow fire and make an unguent in the usual way and treat with this.
