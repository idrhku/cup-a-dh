Another unguent for general use. Take 1 ounce of ox marrow, 6 ounces of ordinary oil, 10 ounces of rose oil, 1 lb. of strong vinegar, 5 ounces each of litharge and white lead, 4 ounces each of turpentine and good pitch and 3 ounces of clean wax. Put the pot on a slow fire and put in the oil, wax, marrow, turpentine and pitch and leave them on the fire until they are melted and incorporated. Then remove this from the fire and strain with the pointed sack as described above. Put the empty pot back on the fire and put in the vinegar and rose oil and boil them a little. Put in the litharge and white lead and make it boil slowly, stirring continuously with your spatula so that it does not burn and let it boil until it is hardened so that you can make fine powder of it. Then return the first composition to the fire, that is to the pot, and when it begins to boil put in the powder that you have made above, little by little, incorporating it well with your spatula. Do this for a quarter of an hour. Then remove it from the fire and make medallions of it. Note that if you want, you can make a plaster, unguent or medicated cloths with it as you wish. This unguent is for cleaning sores because it cools, breaks down, draws down and joins sores and is universally the first choice of everyone who treats patients. It is very well tested.
