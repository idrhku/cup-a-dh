Take 4 ounces of rose oil, 2 ounces of white wax, ½ dram of yellow sandalwood and ½ scruple of camphor. Put the oil and the wax in a little pot and put it on a slow fire. Then put in the sandalwood made into very fine powder and continue stirring until it has developed a little body. Remove it from the fire and put therein the cut camphor and stir quickly until it is cold. Then wash it in a bowl with water of roses, of violets and of plantain, each the same amount, 3 or 4 times and the last time leave in a little of this water. Save it in a covered bottle as the powder and it will always be useful for heated kidneys and for every other overheating. Rub with it in the evening and in the morning and you will cure.

Another unguent for cooling the kidneys, also from Galen. Take 2 ounces of rose oil, 1 ounce of white wax, put it on the fire in a pot until it is completely melted and incorporated. Remove it from the fire and put in 4 scruples of cut camphor and one egg white, well beaten, and stir it continuously until it is cool. Then wash it with water of roses and of plantain 4 or 5 times and at the end leave a little of the water and keep it for your needs. Rub the kidneys with this in the morning and evening and it will help you greatly and also will help remove the cause of the infirmity. This is a universal and tested remedy.

Also if you need to improvise you can take a fresh egg white and incorporate it with a very little rose vinegar and bathe along the kidneys and it will help at once.
