Take 1 handful each of lesser centaury, honeysuckle and cat mint. Take 3 jugs of very good white wine, not sweet nor weak, and put the herbs therein to infuse and take a bone of salt pork with a little very old and rancid meat and break it in 2 or 3 places so that the marrow comes forth better and put this in the wine and boil everything together until it reduces 1/3. Then remove it from the fire, strain it and press the herbs well so the substance comes out and save it in a glass flask. Give this wine as a warm syrup to the patient to drink, 4 or 5 ounces in one morning and not in the next, alternately. You can also make it an enema.
