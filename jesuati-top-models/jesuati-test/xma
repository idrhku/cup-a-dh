The herb bonifacia, that is pagan tongue.

Bonifacia is called by many 'pagan tongue' because it has a leaf in the shape of a little pointed tongue placed in the midst of the large leaf.

You should know that this herb is most powerful in sickness of the womb, especially in prolapse. Giving a spoonful of the powder to women to drink in warm broth or wine at the time of the displacement of the womb, rapidly relieves and cures the sickness of the womb.

Also it is powerful and wonderful for those who have hernias in the scrotum or in the groin. Make a powder of its roots or of the herb or both mixed, and give a spoonful to the patient to drink in the morning at dawn with warm broth or wine in the form of a syrup and again in the evening. Continue this drinking for a month or more, until at the end you feel cured. It may seem to you that in the first days all the intestines want to come out of the body through that sick part and you are advised to put on a band or truss and wear it continually, day and night, with it thick and well-wrapped and tight. If you are able to stay a while in repose, you will be cured more quickly of the fissure or rupture. Watch what you eat and keep from adverse things and, with the aid of God, you will be cured quickly because this has been tested. For those who do not have fluent speech, holding some of the herb in the mouth and eating it helps greatly. For little children who do not have fluent language, placing these little leaves on the tongue will make the tongue flexible. This is very well tested and true.
