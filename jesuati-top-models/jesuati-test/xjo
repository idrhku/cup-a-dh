Take 4 ounces of rose honey, ½ ounce of verdigris and ½ ounce of strong rose vinegar. First put the vinegar on the fire and then put in the rose honey and heat until it is well incorporated, stirring it in. Then put in the powdered verdigris and let it boil until it comes to be a reddish color and it will be made. Remove it from the fire and stir with a spatula until it is cold and it will be finished. Put it in a cool place and then use it.
