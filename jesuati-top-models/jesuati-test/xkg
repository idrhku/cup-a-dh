Another very useful oil for nerves, spasms and sores. Take 3 lb. of the oldest olive oil that you can find, 6 ounces of malvasia wine or other good white wine and 1 handful each of flowers of camomile, sage, rosemary, wormwood and rue, cut finely. Put everything together to boil until it is reduced in half on a slow fire. Strain it and press the herbs in the press and extract all the substance by force. Return the oil to the pot and put therein ½ bowl of earthworms washed with white wine, 2 ounces each of sulfur and the white wine described above and reboil it a little. Strain it again through muslin and while it is still warm add 3 ounces of clean wax and then add 1 ½ ounce each of cloves, incense, mastic and laurel berries, all made into very fine powder, and 1 dram of saffron. Stir well with your spatula until everything is well incorporated. When you want to use it, make it warm and rub and soon you will cure, with God's grace.
