Prayer for fever. “Saint Peter was sitting before the gate of Jerusalem. Then the Lord came and he said, 'What are you doing here, O, Peter?' He responded, 'Lord, I am cast down with my fever.' Jesus said, 'Arise, Peter, and send away this fever.' He rose up and at once was healthy and followed him. Peter said, 'I implore you Lord, great and good Lord, that whoever will have carried these words with him, fever will not be able to harm him.' Jesus said, 'So be it, just as you have asked.' ” Carry these words with you and they will free you. Amen. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. You will be cured.
