Take 1 handful each of pimpernel, betony and burdock, all in leaf. Grind them together and put them to soften in a flask of good white wine for 3 days in a row. Then boil this very slowly until it reduces in half. Strain and press the herbs firmly and extract all the substance. Take half a glass of juice of ribwort plantain, one glass of juice of wormwood, 1 lb. of good turpentine, 6 ounces of thick pine tar and 1 ounce each of gum arabic, mastic and white wax, and all these things should be pulverized. Boil them in a pot until nearly cooked. Then put in a glass of mother's milk from a woman who is nursing a male child. Continue stirring it as usual and, when it is removed from the fire, until it is cold. Do not remove it from the fire until it has made a good body and then it will be made, an unguent with which to medicate wounds in the head and cut muscles and nerves. It will cure these quickly.

Unguent from the above that is powerful in any wounds, bruises or blows and does not hurt when used.
