Another to cause the period of a woman. Take 1 handful each of the herb juniper, maiden hair fern, burnet and nettle seeds. Then take 3 flasks of very good white wine and boil everything together until it reduces one third. Then strain it and press the herbs well on the press. Then return this boiled liquid to the fire and put therein 1 dram of crushed saffron and ½ dram each of myrrh, mastic and incense and let it barely boil. Then remove it from the fire and let it cool and strain it. Save it in a glass flask in a cool place, well covered. In the evening when you go to sleep take 4 ounces of it, tepid, and in the morning take 3 ounces in the form of a syrup. Continue this for 3 or 4 days. Those persons who have tested this give true testimony of having attained the desired outcome in great part, if not fully, and the women have been satisfied.

Another to cause menstruation in several ways. Take a root of white lily and roast it. Then crush it and add 1 ounce of laurel oil and ½ ounce of rose oil and incorporate them well together. Then in the evening when you go to sleep, make it very warm and rub all the body and wrap on cloths and it soon softens the hard body and helps the spleen wonderfully and causes menstruation when it is done several times.
