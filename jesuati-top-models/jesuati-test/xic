Take enough old lard from a male pig and cut it in thin slices and string it on the skewer with some leaves of climbing ivy, alternating a slice of lard and a leaf of ivy. Then put it on the fire and turn it very slowly and give just a little fire and when it seems to you cooked, remove it from the fire and put the tip of the spit in a little pot or plate and heat it with the fire from below and keep all the flame away from it and all the fat will strain onto the plate and collect it with care. Take 2 ounces of this fat and 1 ounce of marsh mallow and incorporate them together. Then take a head of garlic and roast it and make fine powder. With this grease rub the hemorrhoids well, outside and inside. Then put on some of the garlic powder. Do this several times and you will cure them quickly.
