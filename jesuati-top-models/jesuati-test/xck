Another cooling and white unguent. Take 6 ounces of rose oil, ½ ounce of turpentine, 3 ounces of veal fat, 2 ounces of white wax, 1 ounce of rose water, 1 dram of camphor and 2 fresh egg whites. Put the oil and the turpentine on a slow fire. When this has decreased by ¼ or 1/3 put in the fat. Remove it from the fire and put in the egg whites and the camphor with the rose water and keep stirring until it is cool. Then use it to rub where the kidneys hurt. Also sometimes it is used in scabies and it is very helpful in this serious irritation and may cure it.
