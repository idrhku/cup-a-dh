Take 1 lb. of olive oil, 4 scruples of fir tree oil, 3 ounces each of turpentine, pine tar and Greek pitch, 2 ounces of clean wax, 5 ounces of goat fat and Â½ ounce of verdigris. Put the oil, the fir tree oil, turpentine, tar, pitch and the cut-up fat in a pot and melt them completely. Then strain them in a pointed sack, pressing firmly with the sticks. Return it to the pot and put in the cut-up wax and make it boil enough to be cooked. Put in the verdigris, chopped finely, and let it incorporate well on the fire, stirring continuously. When it is cooked, remove it from the fire and stir until it is cold and it will be made, a wonderful and worthy unguent that can be used to treat every wound. If you want to make it stronger to eat away dead tissue better, add more verdigris and also a little rock alum and add it in the way described above and it will be made.
