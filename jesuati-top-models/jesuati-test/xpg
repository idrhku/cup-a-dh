Note that these are distilled in this way: roses, violets, carnations, jasmine or other flowers, or herbs like basil, tamarind or sage or whatever herbs are desired. You should know that the water carries with it essence from the things that you have put there. If you will do this distillation you will please the laity and especially the excellent and expert physicians who will not carry out so much boiling and decocting. It has been found that this will be more pleasing by being more delicate, clear and beautiful.

Be careful that the container that is around the tower must be covered so that the heat does not escape or go away and it should always be kept warm so it will distill more rapidly. The water should always stay full and equal to the opening of the tubes so the heat can always get out into the container of hot water and it distills readily as you have intended. This method of distilling is much used in places that have large and frequent use.

To distill various kinds of odorous waters in the bain marie.

First take some tender leaves of laurel and leaves of cedar, of lemon, of oranges, of myrtle and of greater trefoil and distill each by itself in the bain marie, as you see in the figure below. Otherwise distill as in that above where many are distilled in the bain marie. I draw this other for you in the other way so that you can take that which suits you better. Then after they are distilled, put each one by itself in the sun for 15 to 20 days, well covered, because the sun decomposes them and gives each one a certain blend composed of its special odor that when it is smelled, comforts the feelings and its odor is more gentle. This is the way to mix these waters to make an odoriferous, elegant and most invigorating water.

Take the following kinds of waters distilled on the bain marie. These are odorous waters such as rose water or water of orange flowers, of myrtle, trefoil, marjoram, basil, sweet balm or jasmine or other odorous waters such as are made of cakes of rose, cedar, lemon, honeysuckle or squash flowers. Of these kinds of waters you can make a mixture of 3 or 4 or 5 kinds put together, as will be described. Take 5 lb. of rose water, 1 lb. each of trefoil, lavender and basil waters, 2 lb. of water from tender laurel leaves, 2 ½ lb. of water from cedar, 1 ½ lb. of lemon water and 3 lb. each of waters of orange flowers and of myrtle. Put all these waters together in a vitreous or tin-plated vessel. Cover it well and leave it in the sun for 3 or 4 days. Then if you wish to make it perfect and good so that your reputation is spread around, add in these things written below, that is, 3 ounces of solid storax, 4 ounces of yellow sandalwood, 1 ounce of aloe wood, 5 ounces of benzoin gum, 2 ½ ounces of cinnamon sticks, 2 ounces of cardamon or grains of paradise and 3 nutmegs. Everything should be cut up and not well-ground and the cinnamon sticks should be entire. Put all these components in the water. Stopper it well and let it stay in the hot sun for at least a month or more until it is well compounded together. Otherwise you can boil it on a slow fire, well covered, for a half hour.

Then you can scent the water with musk in this way. Have a flask for 6 or 7 lb. and put therein 4 to 6 grains of musk finely ground with 2 or 3 drops of good oil or with 3 drops of brandy and with fine sugar. With this you can make 3 or 4 kinds of perfumes with ambergris, with civet and with camphor or with other odors as you or anyone wishes. When you have composed it, let it stay in the sun for 15 to 20 days, well covered, and you will have a very odorous and elegant essence to give to any noble, high-class, elegant person.

The most alluring perfumed water, very aristocratic and perfect.

Take 1 handful each of lavender flowers, roses and musk roses and put all these flowers in a glass bell jar and put these powders on them, viz. ½ ounce each of grains of paradise, nutmeg, fine cinnamon and powdered cloves, ½ dram of camphor, 3 drams of scraped or ground aloe wood, 4 grains of ambergris and 1 ounce of powdered sedge. Also you can put in other flowers and mix well and put on the cover and distill it on the bain marie or on a slow fire. You will have a water never equalled in fragrance that greatly invigorates the brain and aids in retaining memory. This is the water for princes, dukes and kings.

Another fragrant water to make with little expense. Take one carafe, about one pound more or less at your discretion, of rose water or other fragrant water and put in 3 or 4 drops of odorous oil. Shake it and stir well up and down so the oil is well incorporated. Cover it and let it stay in the sun for one day and it will take on the odor of the oil. You will be able to sell or give it at your pleasure to any great lord and lady and it will bring you honor.

Another. To make Water of the Angels, very grand and elegant for every use. Viz. Take 3 flasks each of rose water and orange flower water, 1 flask each of water of the tops of sour oranges, of Canary balm, of clover and of basil, 1 lb. of benzoin gum, 1 ounce of spikenard, 8 ounces of solid storax, 1 dram each of musk, civet and amber and 1 ½ ounces of cistus gum. Make a fine powder of the above spices and put them together with the waters in a vitreous receptacle. Incorporate everything well together, shaking it upside down. Cover it well and let it stay thus for one day in the sun undisturbed so that all is well incorporated. Then take this composition and distill it in a glass still with a low fire or on a bain marie and you will have a water never more odorous and sweet that you can put before any great prince.

Another and similar Water of the Angels. Take 3 lb. each of rose water and orange flower water, 1 lb. each of water of basil and of clover. Then put in 8 ounces of benzoin gum, 3 ounces of solid storax, ½ ounce each of aloe wood and powdered sedge, ½ dram of musk, 3 grains of civet and as much fine sugar as half a chestnut. Grind the musk finely with ½ ounce of good oil and also grind the civet with the sugar. The other things should be in powder. Incorporate everything and boil in a carafe or other suitable vessel, well covered, for an hour on the bain marie. Then leave it in the sun for 10 to 15 days and it will be made, perfect, elegant and good. It can be placed before any great prince.

Another like the above. Viz. Take 3 lb. each of water distilled in the glass still from leaves of laurel, from cedar, from myrtle, from lemon and from oranges. All these should be from young leaves. Make it in the way described above.

Another water like the first. Take 3 lb. of water of grains of paradise and 1 lb. of water of musk roses and distill in the way described above with 2 grains of musk and 6 grains of civet, ground in the usual way with sugar. Put this in a flask and put it in the sun, well closed, for at least 15 to 20 days and it will be made, perfect, odorous and elegant. Waters like these are made especially for gentlemen and for people who have the means to spend.

*Many remedies to cure the spleen in diverse ways.

Take the juices of cyclamen and watercress, old olive oil and fresh butter, as much of one as the other and rub.

*Another. Make it with 1/3 lavender oil. That is, if each of the above-described things is half a pound, the lavender oil is two ounces.

*Another. Use as much clean wax as suffices to put all the above things together and boil them together on a slow fire until it reduces ¼. Rub the side of the spleen with this warm and put on a smooth warm cloth. Note that if you want to cure the pain of the spleen, one should watch out for the things written below. That is, every legume, vinegar, pork meat, new wine and raisins.

*Another. Tamarisk leaves cooked in water and drunk. This water reduces the spleen. When the bark of tamarisk is cooked with wine, it relieves the hard spleen. A wine decoction of the ash tree, drunk on an empty stomach cures the spleen. This has been tested.

*An ointment for the spleen. Rub the spleen with mallow and fresh butter with the patient in the sun or by the fire. The patient should be fasting. In another way, take wheat flour, barley flour, flax seed, fenugreek, dry figs and raisins soaked in vinegar, then boiled, rinsed and strained, with added wax and oil to make an unguent with which to rub the spleen.

*For blockage of the spleen and liver that comes from indigestion. Take dry cow dung, nettle juice, 3 eggs, old ordinary oil and sulfur and incorporate everything together and make a plaster and put it on the sore place.

For sickness of the spleen and the liver and dropsy, hold to it as beyond understanding. It is a gift given by God.

*For sickness of the spleen . Take the spleen of an ox and put it in a pot with 2 pails of water and cook it until almost all of the water is consumed. Then take the spleen as warm as one can stand and wrap it in a linen cloth and put it on the sick spleen. When it becomes cold, reheat it on the grill and put it on again. Do this 3 times and do it in the morning on an empty stomach and stay covered up in bed at once. Then take oil of capers and of laurel and rub them warm over the location of the sick spleen and put on warm cloths and in a few days it will be resolved. Give this beverage to drink. Take one handful each of fern, horehound, savin and tamarisk and boil them with good white wine. Make 9 glasses of this and take one glass every morning on an empty stomach and soon, with God's grace, you will be cured. This has been tested.

To distill diverse compositions of flowers, herbs and roots to make fragrant waters. Take some of the cakes of distilled roses that are somewhat soft and put them in a tub or other vessel in whatever amount you want. Put in some leaves of laurel, orange, lemon or cedar and some leaves of spike lavender or lavender and other odorous herbs and roots in whatever quantity you want as long as they are tender. Then put on some very warm water that covers them at least four fingers deep. Cover the vessel well and put it in a place that will stay warm, if you can, and let it stay thus for at least 6 to 8 days until it is heated together. Stir it every day with a rod or with the hands, bottom to top, so that everything incorporates well. Then distill the mixture in the still of your choice. If you distill it in a lead still it is truly good and odorous. But if you distill it in glass in the way described above, it will come out better for you, clearer and more fragrant. One who wants it clear and beautiful needs to keep the fire slow. There is a real risk that it may take on a bad odor, smoky or burnt, and the water will come out another color than white.

If, by chance, the water comes out red when distilled and you want it to be white, distill it one more time and it will come out white, clear, beautiful and fragrant. Although it it true that it loses some of its odor, you will improve its composition. This water picks up odors and you can make different kinds of odors compounded with spices and with aromatic herbs and it will turn out very well for you.
