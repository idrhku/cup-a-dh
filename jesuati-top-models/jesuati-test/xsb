Wine of rosemary that has more virtues than the human tongue can say and its electuary and its oil that is like a balsam. Of this wine one can make brandy.

Take stems, leaves and flowers of rosemary and mince them coarsely. Then take 1 lb. of this herb and 9 lb. of must from dry grapes and boil them together. Skim it well and make it boil for an hour. Then put it in a small barrel and let it clear and it will be made. Drink the amount of one or 2 fingers in a glass in the morning on a empty stomach.

Another to make an oil of these flowers of rosemary which is like a synthetic balsam. Viz. Take a glass vessel and fill it with it with crushed flowers of tamarind that are clean and cover it well with a double layer of waxed cloth with a little leather so that no gases can escape and bury it up to the neck in sand in a warm place. Let it stay for one month or more until the flowers are dissolved and become like water. Then collect this clear water and put it in a bottle in the sun and let it stay for 40 days and it will become thick like oil. Then remove it for it is made. This water is powerful to sustain the heart and the brain and all the body, to soothe weak nerves, to remove birthmarks and spots on the face and to preserve youth.
