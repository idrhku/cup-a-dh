For those who have the French sickness in their hands, that is for one who has those cracks that are healed and then redevelop. Make this bath and you will cure them quickly. Take running water or water from the forge or white wine and boil in these three things, that is 2 ounces each of brazil wood and barley and 1 handful of myrtle. Boil until it reduces 2/3. Soak the palms of the hands in this warm liquid and you will cure them soon. Then rub yourself with this cream. Take fat of male goat and marrow of the shin bone of the ox and mix them together. Rub several times with this grease and soon you will be cured. This has been tested.

Another, a mouth wash for the French sickness. Take 1 lb. of white honey and a mezeta of good white wine and 3 quatrini of rock alum. Put everything together and boil it until it is foaming. Then strain it finely. Hold it in the mouth as warm as you can stand and rinse yourself well with it. Then spit it out. Also wash the sores, that is the scabs. It will help greatly to dry them up quickly.
