Take 1 ounce each of goat fat, earthworms and clean wax. Put 4 ounces of rose oil in a little pot and put therein the fat, cut minutely, and the earthworms washed with vinegar and the cut wax. Melt everything together on a little fire. Then strain it finely and put the composition again in the pot and finish cooking slowly, stirring continuously until it has made enough body. When it is cool and well blended, preserve it and use it for your needs.

Best unguent for cuts or wounds.

Take 1 handful of roots of marsh mallow, well washed and clean, and boil them in 2 lb. of olive oil on a slow fire until it reduces ¾ and until the roots become dark in the pot. Then remove it from the fire and strain it through muslin, pressing the roots well. Then put it back on the fire and add 3 ounces of turpentine and 1 ½ ounces of clean wax and compound this in the form of an unguent and it is done. Spread it on little plasters and treat the sore or wound and it will bring you honor.
