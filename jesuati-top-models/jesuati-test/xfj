Another to break the stone and in bladder and in the kidney. Take a goat of 2 years in the month of August and at the half moon and kill it after it has eaten nothing for a month before except climbing ivy. Collect all the blood and distill it in a glass still with a slow fire and save the liquor that comes out as something valuable. In the morning early, drink 4 ounces warm with sugar in it and also bathe the pubic area, the penis and the rump and stay in repose for 2 hours but do not sleep. Do this for 6 to 8 mornings and you will see a very good effect. It will break the stone in the bladder and even in the kidney and you will urinate very copiously in a short time.
