Take 1 dram each of flour of oak galls, cypress berries, mastic, Armenian red clay and myrtle leaves and make them into very fine powder. Then boil this in very strong vinegar until it is thickened in the form of a poultice and, as warm as one can stand, put it on the hemorrhoids, binding it well so that it does not fall off. Do it several times warm like this and in a few days they will be dried up and you will not feel them any more and you will be cured.
