Note that if you want to make the conserve of borage, that is a confection or electuary of flowers of borage or bugloss or flowers of tamarind or water lilies and violets or French lavender, first take these flowers, only the flowers pure and clean of every pedicle, and cut them as minutely as you can and grind them as well as you can, because its delicacy consists of being well ground. Take 4 ounces of it and 1 lb. of sugar, always 1 part to 3 parts, and grind them well together. This is intended for crushed white sugar but if you put in red sugar, always put in a little more which is better in every way and it keeps the electuaries always soft and rich. Then put it in your bottle, covered with parchment, and make several openings with the point of a knife and put it in the sun for several days. Each day stir it with your stirring rod. Especially in the water lily electuary, do not fill up the bottle because it swells terribly and stir it often so that it does not overflow the bottle. If you wish to cook it, hold to the rules given above to purify the sugar with egg white. Strain it and give it the usual cooking and then put in your flowers which have been well ground and in this way you will make it good and perfect.

Note in part some of the virtues of these electuaries and first of the red sugar. Taken in the morning, it comforts the stomach and the heart and strengthens debilitated intestines. Drinking it in the summer with water will cool all the body and improve nourishment and also it is a tested remedy for phthisis.
