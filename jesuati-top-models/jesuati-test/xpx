There is no cold venom that it cannot draw out, such as terrestrial spider, serpent, fly or scorpion. If one puts a cloth wet in this water on the serpent or similar poisonous animal, it is dead at once, even if it does not touch them and does the same for any other cold venom. Washing the bite of the spider or the serpent several times with this water may cure it and drinking some with wine. It has power like the balsams and the greater theriac. If ringworm or scabies is washed twice a day it will remove it. Put a little lye in the water and let it stay for a day and a night and then put 2 or 3 drops in the ear and any noise that often comes goes away at once. If you put an amount of germander in this water equal to the weight of the water or alternatively as much human blood and let everything stay together for a day and a night and then put 3 or 4 drops in a deaf ear and do this 3 or 4 times and the ear will be freed from deafness, from whatever cause. This cure is made with the dry herb. This water cures every toothache that comes from cold humors. It is true that washing the teeth with it kills the worms and the humors that hide in the root of the teeth. It relieves the distress of paralysis and every infirmity of the nerves by washing with it. This water penetrates so well that when a drop is put in the center of the hand, at once and without any harm it will penetrate into the hand. It cures swelling of the feet, legs and joints and reduces any infirmity that comes from cold phlegm or infected blood as long as it is used in the way described above. Note that this water always stays clear, I say, very clear and it is excellent in every degree and, in my judgment, the most excellent that can be found.

The properties written above and those written below are properties and virtues of brandy or ‘burning water’ which have all been tested. Viz.
