Very perfect nitric acid according to Aristotle, with its properties.

Take 2 lb. of ground Roman vitriol, 1 lb. of very fine saltpeter, 6 ounces of chopped up cinnabar and 1 lb. of fine strong ash. Incorporate these 4 things together well and distill them in a glass retort luted well around and on a little, slow fire. When you see the cap of the retort becoming yellow, the first water has been made and be quick to remove the receptacle below and put there another collecting flask and seal it well around so the fumes do not leak out. Continue with a slow fire with dry wood and take the second water from its position below and keep it well sealed so it will not give off all its spirit. Do not ever let the fire get too hot and continue until the cap is no longer very yellow and then all will be made. Save this.

Another. If you wish to adorn any work of iron, first paint your iron with liquid varnish and let it dry by the fire in the usual way. Then mark the design on it with your little iron tips that you have prepared. Then put this water on the design, putting wax from a candle around so that the water does not drip onto any other place. Let it stand for one hour, more or less, according to how you see the work well incised or not. Then wash it with fresh water and this water will not bite in any more. Take some filings of iron with a little cork or soft wood and rub away the varnish and the iron will be bright and clean with the design that you have made.

Another. If you put some copper beaten thin into this water it will dissolve. If you should put some of this water on a person it will distroy all the flesh that it touches and it will be difficult to heal.

If by chance you want to break a piece of iron, wet some cloths and put them on the place where you want it to break and in 3 or 4 or more times it can be broken in that place but do not wet other places.

Another. If you put some lead in this water and bathe with it where you have some hair, the hair will go away miraculously and quickly and will not return again.

Another. If you want to cure warts or bad flesh, break open the wart with the tip of a needle so there is a little pocket that brings out blood. Put thereon a little of this water 3 or 4 times and the wart will go away.

Another. If you wish to remove fistulas or any abcesses, wet some cloths in this water and put them on and soon you will be cured.

Another. If you wish to cut or break the flesh in any place, that is to cauterize, make a little plaster and cut an opening in the middle the size that you want it on the flesh and put the plaster so it stays on the flesh. Then bathe several times with this water where you have cut the plaster and the flesh will be broken open in exactly that place.

Another. If you wish to remove letters that are on parchment, wet it lightly with the water with a brush. Then with your little knife, shave carefully and lightly and it will go away so nothing will be seen.

Another. If you wish to make a medium blue color, put calcined tin in this water and as it settles to the bottom, remove the water that is on top and at the bottom it will be azure.
