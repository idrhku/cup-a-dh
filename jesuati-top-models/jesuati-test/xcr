by all the names of the omnipotent God, that furthermore you may not harm nor should you harm the woman (name) who is a servant of God, nor the man (name) who is a servant of God. I implore all the roots of the womb that you do not harm, nor molest, nor disturb the woman or the man who is a servant of God (name). Pater agla helii o emanuel adonay, alpha e omega. So God was crucified for the redemption of the world and suffered on the Cross and on the third day was resurrected from death. He set free Enoch and Peter from the sea and the three boys from the fiery furnace, Shadrach, Mesach and Abednego +, so may you think your servant worthy to be set free from all burning and heat of the womb. + Christ conquers, Christ + rules, Christ + orders. + May Christ from that pain defend you. Amen + + +.'
