Say over a sore or wound. ' God was born, God was taken and bound, betrayed and suffered crucifixion and died for us wretched sinners. God was resurrected on the third day, according to the Scripture. As this is true, so this illness can neither become corrupt, nor putrefy, nor cause any pain, if it is pleasing to God and the Virgin Mary.' Make over it the sign of the cross. Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.
