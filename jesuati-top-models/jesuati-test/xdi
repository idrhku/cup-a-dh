Prayer against fever to carry on you.

'+Christ was born. + Christ suffered. + Christ was raised on the cross. + Christ was placed in the sepulchre. + Christ who was set free from death, free your servant (name) from the rigors of quartan, tertian and quotidian fever. + Christ conquers, Christ reigns, Chirst orders. Amen. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.'
