Take green twigs of the ash tree cut in minute pieces and put them in a pot that has many holes in the bottom. Then have another pot without holes that is larger than the first one and put the first one at least half way into the larger pot without holes. Bury this almost completely in the earth or in sand with the first one covered so that no dirt can get in. Then lute the joint between one pot and the other with cloth or clay or with flour dough so that no air escapes and the upper pot, that has in it the cut wood, is covered with the cover well-sealed around. This pot should be more than half above ground but first everything should be sealed around with good lute of wisdom and dried. Then make a fire around it with burning charcoal for the space of 2 or 3 hours, according to the size of the pot and the amount of wood in it. At the end, make the fire lively and then let it cool in place. Then remove the pot carefully so the dirt does not get in. In the bottom of this pot you will find water and oil from the wood of the ash tree. Save this with great care in a well-covered glass bottle.

*Oil of camphor that is powerful for redness of the face and also for many other things. Viz.

Take a bronze mortar and take 6 to 8 almonds without shells and rub them around with the pestle at the bottom of the mortar until it is all oil. Then take 1 ounce, more or less as you wish, of natural camphor and grind it in the mortar so smooth that it becomes impalpable. Then make a good fire of charcoal. You want the bottom of the mortar to be in the fire with the top tilted and put there a cup to collect the oil that drips out from the mortar. Save that very carefully, well-sealed. In this way you will have oil of camphor. This oil mixed together with white lead is the best for those who have morphea on the face and nose and the face is as red as that of Saint Lazarus. Rubbing with this oil in the morning and evening helps the condition greatly.

*Oil of white lead for the face, as above. Take white lead and distilled vinegar and extract the quintessence as it is obtained through the bain marie.
