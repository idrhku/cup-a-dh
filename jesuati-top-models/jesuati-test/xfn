Take a quince and grate it all minutely and take 2 ounces each of oil of roses, or violets, of camomile and of water lily and put everything together in a little pot and boil it until the fruit is well cooked on a low fire so it does not burn. Then strain it through canvas and press it well so everything comes out that can. Put it again on the fire and put therein ½ ounce each of powdered incense and yellow litharge and 1 ½ ounces of clean wax. When it is well melted, remove it from the fire and put in ½ ounce of camphor cut up and stir it in with a stirring rod of wood until it has cooled and it will be made. Save it for your needs as it is good for 10 years and more. When your back hurts you through weakness or from pain of the kidneys, rub the kidneys in the evening and in the morning, always downward, and soon, through God's grace, you will be cured. Be careful what you eat. Do not eat things warming as they are unfavorable. This has been very well tested.
