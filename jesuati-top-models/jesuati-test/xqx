'I pray to you most sweet Jesus Christ for your five wounds and the harsh torment you have borne on the Cross for me, wretched sinner. You arrange today and always in all places, hours and moments my soul, my body, my acts, thoughts, speech, desires and on my journey peace, health and prosperity to please you with good works from me, a miserable sinner, that I may be strong to depart from this life with true penitence, pure confession, fitting amends, pious body, clean heart, steadfast catholic faith and the sacred holy eucharist and anointed with holy oil. You, Lord Jesus Christ, who are able to save me through the intercession of the most blessed Virgin Mary, your most sweet Mother, may my words and deeds be pleasing to you. Give to me counsel in all tribulations, help in all needs, patience in all adversity, moderation in all prosperity and at the end everlasting rejoicing. Amen. Through Christ, our Lord.'
