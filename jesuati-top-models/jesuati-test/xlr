Take about 10 snails with shells, that is snails collected in the month of September when they begin to make the white lid. Grind them in a mortar with the shells and their lids, everything as they are. When they are well ground, add 1 handful of dittany roots and grind them together so they are well incorporated. Then add 3 ounces of cherry gum, which first should be dried and made into fine powder, and incorporate this with the other things in the mortar until it seems to you that everything is united well together. If it seems to you that they are not well ground or that they cannot be ground, cut them on a slab as is done to beat lard so that they become well ground and incorporated together and the plaster will be made in this way. Then spread it on a smooth cloth or a little smooth sheepskin. Put it on the rupture in the pubic area with several layers and bind with a truss of fustian or smooth cotton cloth so it stays tight and close. Stay in repose as much as you can and do not do much that is fatiguing and do not partake of things that are adverse, such as women, legumes, sour fruit and pork and be careful of all things causing gas. By taking care of yourself, through God's grace, soon it will be cured. This remedy is intended for those who are ruptured recently, in a year or so, and especially it is very appropriate to use with little children. It is said that they are cured, if they have no other sickness, at the end of 2 months or less, according to whether the infirmity is large or small. Change the plaster at least every 10 or 15 or 20 days because the plaster will heat up and turn bad and develop odor because the snails will begin to putrefy. For this reason you should change it a little each time. This plaster will last longer in the winter than in the summer in this respect, because you will need to change it every 8 days in the summer. Follow the rules and you will be cured.
