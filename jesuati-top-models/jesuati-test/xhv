Another to cure hemorrhoids. Take clean roots of the herb pilewort in which the roots seem precisely like the top of a row of piles stuck together. Cook these very well in rose oil. Then distemper them with this rose oil and a little butter and make this in the form of an unguent. Rub yourself with this warm, several times and soon you will be cured.
