Another for burning in the penis and for gravel. Take agrimony with its roots and wild tansy. Dry them in the shade and make very fine powder of them. Then give one spoonful in a glass of warm white wine to the patient to drink in the evening when he goes to sleep, for 4 or 5 evenings. Rub the kidneys with the oil described above. The patient should not eat warming things that are not good in this illness. By following this he will urinate soon and without burning in the penis and there will be much gravel and it will remove this warming material. Again, the wild radish is good, that is its ground seed. Giving a spoonful to drink with warm white wine in the evening will help him greatly. Also it is said that a dose of the powered berries of climbing ivy, given to drink with warm white wine every 2 days for the space of 15 days, causes much gravel to be urinated and even breaks the stone, little by little, so the man does not feel it and he will urinate abundantly and without distress. This is a great secret. Do not ignore the rules given above.

To cause urination. Take 3 ounces each of water of fennel, of asparagus, of butcher's broom, of celery and of hound's tongue and 2 ounces of wine of sour pomegranates, 6 ounces of Syrup of 2 Roots and 1 ounce of minced licorice. Boil everything together with 2 ounces of fine sugar in a glass vessel until it is reduced one third. Then strain it and early in the morning give a glass of it, warm, and also in the evening 2 hours before supper. By continuing this one is able to urinate at pleasure and without any distress.
