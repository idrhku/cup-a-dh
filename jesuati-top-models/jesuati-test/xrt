Another electuary of juniper berries. Viz. Take whatever quantity of juniper berries that you want and take a jug of good white wine and put it in a pot. When it begins to raise to a boil, then put in the berries and do not let them boil. Remove it at once from the fire and cover it well and let it cool. Then extract them as usual and dry them in the shade. Eat 10 to 15 of these early in the morning on an empty stomach and you will have a very good stomach, as described above. Likewise, you can make an electuary with sugar or honey. That is, take 1 ounce of berries made into fine powder and 3 ounces of sugar or honey. Make it as usual and take it in the usual way.

*Oil of juniper is powerful for many things and has much value and is powerful for every sore, old or new, and in canker and fistula when they are rubbed repeatedly.
