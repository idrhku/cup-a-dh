Take well-washed mallow roots and remove the central part and take 1 lb. of that and cook it in water. Grind it and pass it through a cloth sieve. Then return it to the pot on the fire and add 1 ½ lb. of clean honey and boil it until it is well incorporated and add a sparrow, cleaned and finely ground, and incorporate it well with your spatula. Remove it from the fire and let it cool a little. Then add ½ ounce of cinnamon and 1 ½ ounces of powdered licorice and mix very well and it will be made, the best electuary for all the above infirmities. Take a spoonful of it in the morning and one in the evening, one hour before meals. If this electuary is used for impairment of the spleen and for distress of the stomach, over time you will be cured. Take care of your way of life, and especially refrain from fruits and from other green plants and sour foods and legumes. Do not drink cold water and most of all do not touch pork meat, nor women, and exercise temperately and stay warm. Observe this and in a short time you will be cured through God's grace.

Prayer for sickness of the womb.
