Another to cure hemorrhoids. Take 4 ounces of oil of roses, 20 sow bugs, 3 cockroaches and Â½ bowl of earthworms washed with white wine. Put everything in a little pot and boil it on the warm ashes very slowly until it seems ready to you. Put the little animals in cold oil because otherwise they will burn. Then it will be made. Rub the hemorrhoids with this oil inside and out with a feather. The oil should be warm. Soon you will be cured. If you wish the cure to be quick, do not drink wine nor eat things that are preserved in salt and you will be cured.
