'May the power of the Father, the wisdom of the Son, the excellence of the Holy Spirit free your servant (name) from all fever through the intercession of the Virgin Mary and through the merit of the holy martyrs, Cyprian, William, Albert, George and Sigmund, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen. Christ who was born is the Father. Christ who died is the Son. Christ lives again in the Holy Ghost. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.' Carry this with you.

Prayer against fever. 'Christ was born, Christ suffered, Christ was crucified. Free your servant (name) from the fever to the honor of the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, Saint Peter, Saint Gismond, Saint Anne, Saint Bartholomew and Saint Honofry and all of the saints of God, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen. + + + .'
