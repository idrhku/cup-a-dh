Another for falling sickness. Take leaves and seed of the herb dragon root or the root or some of its berries and give it to the sick one to drink. Also take some peony made into powder and take bone from the head of a dead man who has been in a coffin and scrape it with a knife or file it, and the fur of a white dog, cut finely. Put everything together and give it to the patient to drink with 3 ounces of red wine with broth or soup. If it is a little child make it smell rue repeatedly. Then rub some bread with roasted oil and give it to eat. It helps greatly. Then take a nail from the coffin of a dead man and make it into a ring and put it on the marriage finger and it greatly helps in this falling sickness. Have the patient wear around the neck this little charm, viz: '+ Amen + treat + your + old age + gently + remove + fevers + disease + and also repel + sudden + death'. Soon you will be cured, through God's grace.

Oil for the sickness called ugly.

Take 2 ½ lbs. of old ordinary oil and 1 ½ lbs. of malvasia or other potent wine, 1 handful each of rosemary, hyssop, ave lustro , marjoram, sage, rue and southern wood. All these should be washed and clean and cut finely and boiled together until the malvasia is reduced in half. Then add two thirds of the items written below, viz.:1 ½ ounces each of galingale and musk and 1 ounce each of cloves, cinnamon and ginger and let all these items cook on a very slow fire until the rest of the malvasia is used up. Then strain it through a fine cloth and put the remaining third of the items into the pure oil that has been strained and add 1 lb. of ordinary oil to the above. Then it should be put in the sun, well-covered, for several days and it will be made. With this oil rub the sick person all over the stomach and the back up to the head, going down as far as the kidney and the edge of the kidney. Through God's grace soon he will get better.
