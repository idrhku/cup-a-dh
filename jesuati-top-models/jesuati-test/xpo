Take 6 drams of red roses, 5 drams of sedge, 3 drams each of cloves, mastic, lavender and wild spikenard and 1 dram each of cinnamon and crocus. All these things should be well ground and sieved and cooked with 1 lb. of cherry plums and with 7 lb. of ordinary water. Boil it until it reduces 1/3. Then strain it and put in 1 lb. of cleaned honey and let it cook until it becomes thick. Put in the above powder and stir well with a spatula of willow or cedar wood until it is well incorporated. Put in one dram of musk. Give the amount of a nut of this in the morning and the evening with good white, odorous, undiluted wine.

Another to make a good, retentive memory in a short time in a way that reading a great sermon in the evening, you will have it all in memory in the morning. Viz. Take 8 glasses of ordinary water and 2 ounces each of laurel leaves and French lavender and boil them until it is reduced more than in half. Then strain it and squeeze the leaves well in the press. Put in a little well-washed turpentine. First wash your head with good lye and dry it and rub the temples with this ointment. This is a proven thing.
