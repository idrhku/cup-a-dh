Another to cure hemorrhoids very quickly. Take some of the green branches of elder and boil them in water from the blacksmith and when they are about cooked, spread them on a smooth cloth of rose-red as large as a hand and with the sick person lying down on his back, put this warm on the hemorrhoids and say a miserere and put on another of the poultices and put on a little rose or violet oil. Do this change every half hour for the period of 3 or 4 hours. I tell you that very soon they will be cured. Maintain it on always very warm. Do this in the evening when the patient goes to sleep and as soon as he goes to sleep the pain will cease. He will find himself already healed and will not feel pain, if he will not do anything disorderly, that is eating anything harmful. You will cure him quickly by doing this.

*Another to cure rapidly the piles that come to women after giving birth.

Take 6 scruples of camphor ground very finely and one or 2 quatrini of Unguento bianco and incorporate them together and rub in the morning and evening and soon you will cure. Antonio.
