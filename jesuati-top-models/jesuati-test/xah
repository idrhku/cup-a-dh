Take white lead and wash it with 2 drams of rose water, and take sarcocol gum washed with asses' milk, and tarragon and celery, each Â½ dram, and make very fine powder of everything and incorporate it with water distilled from strawberries until it becomes liquid. Then put in a little mother's milk. Then put some of this water in the eye with a feather, 2 or 3 times a day, and soon you will be cured of the stinging in the eye. This is tested.
