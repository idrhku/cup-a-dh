Take 6 ounces of rose oil, 5 ounces of clean wax, 4 ounces of turpentine, 2 ounces of marsh mallow and 1 ounce each of incense, mastic, galbanum and opopanax gum. Put all the gums to soften in strong vinegar that barely covers them. Then remove them and liquify them alone in the pot, stirring until they are melted. Then put in the oil, turpentine and marsh mallow and incorporate them well and let it cook. Lastly put in the wax cut into little pieces and, as it melts, remove it from the fire and strain it still warm through bunting and stir until it is cold and it will be made, to use at your pleasure. Know that for all unguents it is necessary to stir until they are cold, using your stirring rod or spatula, and this rule holds in making all kinds of unguents.

Digestive.

Take 1 ounce of turpentine, the yolk of a fresh egg, rose oil, fresh barley flour, saffron and dried rock alum, each at your discretion, and a little rose honey. When these are heated, compound them together and it will be made. Then use it to treat at your pleasure and it will bring you honor.

Protective.
