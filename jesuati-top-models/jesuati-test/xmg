Take 1 dram each of high quality myrrh, betony, Armenian red clay, primula and ground pine, 2 drams each of burnet saxifrage, germander and hepatic aloe and Â½ dram of crocus. Mix each with sage or ground pine water, rose honey and primula water and compound everything together and make a paste from which one makes three pills the size of a chick pea to take by mouth before eating either in the morning or the evening. This is effective.
