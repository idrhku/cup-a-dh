First say 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Maria with devotion. Take a pot of clean water in whatever amount you want, that is not important. Say, 'Let us pray. Having been advised in healthful rules and having been prepared in divine instruction, we venture to say the Pater Noster.' Say all of it. 'Lord, hear my prayer and may my cry come to you.' We pray, 'God, who conferred great power on the blessed Patrick, your confessor, miraculously expelling venomous serpents, give this to us who are your faithful servants, as you grant favors to the faithful, so grant this to whomever will have received a bite of a serpent-like poison, whether from a dog, wolf or worm, by this sacred name, Holy, Holy Savior, to the credit of the blessed Patrick, may he be strong to free us. Amen. In the name of the Father + Son + and Holy + Spirit, Amen.' Give some of this blessed water to the person to drink who is sick from the venoms described above and he will be cured rapidly. If the venom is of the kind that can be cured with the aid of God, it will soon be cured by means of this fervent prayer of Saint Patrick and with 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Maria. Amen.

To cure one who was bitten by a rabid dog.

Take 1 handful of lesser centaury, cut finely, and boil it with new wine until it becomes thick as a syrup. Remove it from the fire, strain it carefully and give 3 ounces to drink early in the morning in the form of a syrup and it will cure this quickly if, as is said, it can be cured.

Otherwise, write these 4 words on a crust of bread and give it to the patient to eat and also make another and give it to the rabid dog, vz. ' Crona bis, crona si nobis, crona decida ardere. + + + Amen.' With the aid of God, he will soon be cured.

*To cure on who was bitten by a rabid dog and has the mania. Viz., take the flower of the wild thistle, dried in the shade, and make powder of it and give Â½ spoonful to drink in warm white wine and in 3 times he will be cured.

Against the venom of bees, wasps, hornets and scorpions.

At once, or as soon as you can, take some purslane, that is portulaca, in whatever amount you can get and grind it between 2 lodestones. When you feel the sting, draw out the sting with the venom and put on the ground purslane. Change it 3 or 4 times in the space of an hour and soon the pain will stop and you will not feel it. But the hard spot that remains also will be resolved in 2 days. If the sting is from a scorpion it is urgent to repeat this several times and this also will be cured. If you are not able to have the above herb, take the juice of a green apple or other sweet apples and do the same thing. This has been tested many times by me, Master Apothecary Andrea.

*Another against venomous animals. As soon as you feel the venom, put on the sting some milk from branches of figs. Do this several times and soon you will be cured. Mustard with vinegar will do the same.

Prayer against all venoms from rabid dogs, serpents or other venoms. Write these words on a plain wafer and give it to the patient to eat, with 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Maria, in reverence to God and to Saint Peter and to Saint Vitus. Do this for 3 mornings in a row and, through the power of God, soon you will cure him. These are the words, viz. '+ Peace + Father + Word + Son +. He is the remedy +. Holy Spirit + through whom all + things are done, + free your servant (name). So be it. Amen. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.'

To domesticate an animal so it does what is wanted.

Say these word in the ear of the animal that you want to domesticate and it will become quiet and more docile than at first and be the animal you want. First say the Pater Noster with the sign of the cross and say, 'God was taken and he was not offended. I wish the same to you. You do not want to offend me. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.'

*Another to domesticate a pair of bullocks. Say this prayer 3 times in the right ear, viz. 'Saint Job was on the Mount of Olives and he was taming young animals. Jesus Christ was passing and Jesus Christ ordered the beast to behave, so he must not paw the earth, nor hit, nor make any trouble as did the friend of the Nestorian priest on the way to the inferno.' So these animals may be tamed at the pleasure of God.

*For pain in the testicles and other illnesses and swellings.

Take the white of an egg and incorporate it with barley flour or bean flour and make a poultice. Put it on warm and soon your pain will be relieved.

*Another for one who has swelling there. Take fresh celery and fry it in ordinary oil and rub the testicles with this and bind on the herb and soon you will be cured.

*Another for the above. Take bean flour, violet juice, rose oil and bran and make a poultice and put it warm on the swollen testicles and soon they will be cured. If only one testicle is swollen, take equal amounts of goat, dog and dove dung and make a poultice of all these and put it warm on the testicle with a little oil of roses and you will cure it rapidly.

*Another for the above. Take fenugreek and make powder of it and mallow and cook these and grind them with lard and butter and make a poultice. Put on some of this powder and put the warm poultice on the testicle and the pain from the swelling will soon disappear. Also take some parsnips and make a plaster and put it on warm and it will soon remove the pains.

*Another in swelling of the testicles. Take oils of white lilies, of elder and of roses. Then take mashed beans cooked in wine or lye and fry them in a pan very well with the oils and then put this very warm on the sore places.

*Another poultice for swollen testicles. Take turpentine, bran, fenugreek flour and powdered cumin, each the same amount, and incorporate them on a slow fire and put this warm on the sore place and you will certainly cure it.

*For excoriation of the penis because of coitus or other overheating.
