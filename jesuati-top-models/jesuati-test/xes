Take 6 ounces of the oldest olive oil that you can find, 3 quatrini each of saffron, incense and powdered cloves, 20 laurel berries and 1 ounce of clean wax. Pulverize everything and put them together in a little pot on a slow fire for the period of one miserere. Remove it from the fire, stirring continuously until it is cold and it will be made. Save it for your needs. When you want to use it, warm it and rub the body well and put on warm cloths and turn on your back. In the space of one hour you will begin to get improvement and, with the aid of God, soon you will be freed of the painful colic and you will not feel more distress.

Another. Take sifted flour and flour of millet and boil them with oil of rue and of camomile, the same amount of each, and with this warm rub the body and soon you will be cured.
