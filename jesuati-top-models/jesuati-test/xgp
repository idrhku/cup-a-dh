For the woman not able to give birth, take 2 scruples of saffron and mix them with good warm wine and give it to her to drink and it will help her greatly. Also say these holy words so that she hears them, viz., 'The heavens tell the glory of God and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. Day to day his word comes forth and night to night his wisdom is revealed. They are not discourses nor utterances. The voices of these may not be heard within the bounds of earth. He has placed his tabernacle in the sun. Come forth as a bridegroom coming from his marriage bed. Elizabeth gave birth to Joan, Anna gave birth to Mary, Mary gave birth to the savior. This mother will give birth without pain, in the name of the Father, + Son + and Holy Spirit, + Amen.' Then do this, take half a glass of milk of a bitch and likewise good wine and a little honey and mix them well and give this warm to her to drink. If the baby should be dead in the body, take powdered myrrh and give it to her to drink with warm wine and with juice of burdock, of sage and of mallow and purge the woman and she will give birth at once without distress.
