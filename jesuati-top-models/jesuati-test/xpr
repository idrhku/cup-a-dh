Another for the voice bothered by catarrh or other impediment. Take 1 lb. each of cabbage juice and honey and put this to clarify on the fire with the white of an egg, well-beaten. When it starts to boil, strain it carefully. Then put it back to boil until it comes to perfection and a drop stays firm on your fingernail. Then remove it and save it in a bottle. In the evening and morning take a spoonful each time and do this for 15 to 20 days and it will protect you from catarrh. It will make you salivate readily and will give you back a good, clear voice without impediment. Take care of how you live. Do not eat things too fatty and everything will go well.
