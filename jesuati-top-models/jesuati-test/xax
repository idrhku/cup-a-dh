Take 1 ounce each of oil of fir and turpentine, rose oil and rose honey and compound them with a slow fire and put in this composition Â½ ounce of honeysuckle poultice or betony poultice, stirring continuously until you see that everything is well mixed. Then remove it from the fire and at once strain it carefully and continue stirring afterward until it is completely cool, and a major and perfect unguent will be made.

Very fine poultice for the head.
