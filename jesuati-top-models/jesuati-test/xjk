Take 1 lb. of oily pine tar, 2 ounces of laurel oil or mastic tree oil and 4 ounces each of sage and elemi gum. First put the tar on the fire until it clears well on a slow fire. Then put in the gum and the other things and incorporate them well on a little fire, always stirring until it is cold and it will be made. Use it at your pleasure in the way you use other unguents, medicating twice a day. But do not medicate the head.
