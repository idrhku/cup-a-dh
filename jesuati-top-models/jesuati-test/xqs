Take 6 lb. of tartar from wine and grind it coarsely and make fine powder and extract the water with 2 flasks as is done in making aqua forte . At the end there it needs enough fire so the flask is dry and the calcined tartar remains within. Then take that oil or water that has issued from the flask and likewise take an equal amount by weight of strong brandy from the third distillation. Then pulverize the tartar that you have calcined and put it in another flask and add the oil mixed with the brandy and redistill it one more time. Then do it again. Distill it in this way enough times so that the tartar will have imbibed all the oil and brandy and it can be made into powder. Save this as something dear. This powder is called the Philosopher's Stone. You should know that one ounce or a little more of this powder will restore a cask of 10 barrels of spoiled wine. First decant it into another cask with a good odor and put in this powder, mixing it in with a rod so that it goes throughout. Then close it well and let it stay so for 30 days. Then test it and, with the aid of God, you will find all restored and as good as at first. This secret is from Bologna from one man who has the skill to repair wines from other persons. He buys them and restores them, then sells them as good, and they are good.

Good wine to make strong vinegar, I say very strong, in several ways.
