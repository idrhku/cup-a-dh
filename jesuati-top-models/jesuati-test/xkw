Take 1 handful each of burnet saxifrage, betony, burdock and valerian, all cut finely, and put them to soften in an earthenware basin with good, fragrant white wine for 4 whole days and boil this in a clean pot until it is reduced in half. Then strain and press the herbs in the press. Put in 1 lb. each of turpentine and strained pine tar, 6 ounces of white wax and a glass of urine from a little child. Return it to a slow fire for Â½ hour and stir continuously because it may boil over. Remove it from the fire and stir until it is cold and can be made into a brick. Then put it again in a container and melt it on a slow fire and at once put therein 1 ounce each of well-pulverized mastic, olibanum, and myrrh and 3 ounces of mother's milk and put these together and stir until it has thickened. Shape it very well with the hands and you will have made the best cerate which has these virtues. It is powerful for cuts and for nerves, for any swellings and to draw out iron or wood from bad flesh, for dog bites or bites of venomous animals, to bring abcesses to a head, to clean up ulcers, fistulas and carbuncles and for every developing growth and for scrofula. It even has many other great tested virtues.

The unguent, God's Grace, to heal and clean every serious wound.
