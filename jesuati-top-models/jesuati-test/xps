Another, a wonderful confection to restore a voice lost through catarrh or cough or for a hoarse voice. Take 1 ounce of quality cinnamon, 2 drams each of grains of paradise and cubeb, one nutmeg, ½ ounce of spike lavender, 2 ounces of pure licorice and 1 lb. of fine sugar. Everything should be finely ground. Incorporate them on a slow fire and make a well-formed electuary. When you go to sleep and early in the morning take 3 drams of this each time. Until you have recovered it is necessary that you eat little and drink less and little wine and in this way you will not feel the catarrh very much or the cough and you will have a very good voice as you did before. Do not neglect the rules listed above and you will succeed.

Also you can take this powder with wine early in the morning. Take 1 ounce each of hyssop, ginger and licorice and ½ ounce of gum arabic. Make everything into fine powder and save it. Take 1 spoonful with 3 ounces of good white wine, tepid, in the morning and soon you will have again a firm and steady voice.
