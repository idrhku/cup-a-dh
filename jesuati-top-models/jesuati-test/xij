Another to remove the pain of hemorrhoids. Take flax seeds and boil them with mallow that has been well washed. When it boils and makes viscous foam, then pour in a little oil of white lilies. When the herb is about cooked, take all this material and put it on a linen cloth and, as warm as can be borne, put it on the hemorrhoids and bind it so it does not fall off. Do this several times and it will remove the pain. Also, take the juice of henbane and an equal amount of oil of sweet almonds and have the well-beaten yolk of an egg and put this mixture warm on a linen cloth and put it on the hemorrhoids. Let it stay on and it will remove the pain quickly. Do this several times and you will cure them.
