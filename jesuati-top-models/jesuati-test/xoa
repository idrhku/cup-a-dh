Take 1 ounce each of fine cinnamon, ginger and cardamon, Â½ ounce each of nutmeg and cloves, and 2 ounces of steel filings, finely ground. Make all into very fine powder. Then take 2 lb. of clean honey and incorporate everything together. Cook it in a pot on a slow fire, stirring continuously until it is reduced 1/3. Then remove it from the fire and put in a little honey and some white bread crumbs. Return it to the fire one more time and reboil it some and it will be made. Strain it and put it in a bottle. In the evening when you go to sleep, take an amount the size of a chestnut, and do the same in the morning when you get up and it will help greatly to reduce the spleen.

For dropsy caused by the spleen.
