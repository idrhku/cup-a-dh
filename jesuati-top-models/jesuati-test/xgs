Another. This is true and tested. When you see a pregnant woman, make the sign of the cross, look her in the face and say together the Pater Noster and the Ave Maria. Then say these 3 little verses, looking at her while she is silent. 'Increate Father, increate Son, increate Holy Spirit, one without creation. Infinite Father, infinite Son, infinite Holy Spirit, one infinity. Eternal Father, eternal Son and eternal Holy Spirit.' Then note well if she puts her hand to her waist to make some adjustment or to arrange something around her neck. If that happens, judge it and say to yourself that she will deliver a male. If she makes a sign from the waist downward, judge the baby to be female. If by chance the woman does not make the sign clearly, say the above words one more time. At the end of 3 times you will see some of these signs appear. If she makes them above the waist, it is judged to be male and if they are made below the waist, it is judged to be female. This sign has been used many times and I have never been in doubt when it is made. It is a simple and straight-forward method and it is true and tested.

Electuary so a woman may have sons.

Take 1 handful each of sage and fine marjoram and boil it in a large carafe with very good malvasia wine until it reduces nearly by half. Then grind these herbs and put in 6 ounces each of very clean honey, fine sugar and fine powdered cinnamon and incorporate everything well together in the mortar and it will be made. Save it in a covered bottle and when the woman goes to bed, she takes an ounce or more, but first is purged. In the morning before she gets out of bed she will feel a warming movement and then she should have intercourse with her husband and soon the result will be seen.
