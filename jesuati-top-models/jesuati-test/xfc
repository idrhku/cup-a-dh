Another to cause urination, a wonderful secret. Take 6 ounces each of kernels of cherry and peach stones, 3 ounces each of medlar stone and medlars, 2 lb. of ribolla or malvasia wine and 3 ounces of white sugar. Put them in a bottle, well closed, for 3 whole days. Then take 6 ounces each of water of flowers of elder, broom, melon, barberry, pellitory, watercress, parsley and agrimony and 3 ounces each of water of winter cherry, samphire and maiden hair fern. Mix all these things together and distill water from them in a glass still and save it carefully. It is precious. The dose is from 1 Â½ ounces to 2 ounces. Keep the patient well covered in bed and when he will have sweated, wipe him well with warm cloths. It is helpful to repeat this again once or twice and he will be freed. This is effective in the difficulty of stone and distress of the kidneys. I have tested this.
