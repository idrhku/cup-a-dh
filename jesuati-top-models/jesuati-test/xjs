Take 1 lb. of rose oil and 1 glass of very good wine and put it in a pot with 3 ounces of turpentine and put in these 3 clean herbs, cut and ground very finely and boiled in this oil until they are well cooked and strained thoroughly through muslin: 1 ½ handfuls of tansy, 1 handful of tamarind flowers and tips, and ½ handful of lesser centaury Then take 6 ounces each of calf and sheep fat, cut minutely, melted, strained and mixed, 1 dram each of frankincense and saffron, 1 ½ drams of pine tar and colofony resin, 2 ½ drams of incense, sarcocol gum and myrrh, 3 drams of mastic and 3 ½ ounces of clean wax. Make powder of all these other things using force and compound them together until everything is well incorporated. Strain it one more time, pressing the sack well so that nothing remains. Return it to the pot and make it boil on a slow fire, stirring continuously so it incorporates well. Before it is cooked, put in the wax and the saffron and remove it from the fire. Wash this warm with milk 3 times and cool it and it will be made. Put it away for your needs, because it is in name and in fact the golden unguent.

White lead unguent for broken flesh and bad fistulas.
