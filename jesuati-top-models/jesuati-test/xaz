Another tested remedy for epilepsy. Bring the epileptic and the father and mother and take them to the church on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and there they hear all the mass and also on Sunday and then at the end of the mass the priest binds on the epileptic's head the gospel precept on which is written, 'This kind of demon will not be cast out except by prayer and fasting,' and soon it will cure the mad and demonized epileptic. This is very true. And he should carry near him the names of these 3 kings: '+ Caspar brought myrrh +, Melchior brought incense +, Balthasar brought gold, +' and do this on Thursday or on Sunday and say over him the Mass of the Three Kings and offer on the altar coins of 3 kinds. The note should be kept under the Bible. Do not ever go without this and you will not suffer from epilepsy, that is from the falling sickness. Do these things and do not be negligent.

Another for the falling sickness, the best remedy that can be made. If the patient is a man, take 3 pieces of the head of a dead man, and if a woman from a woman, who does not have epilepsy, and grind them finely. Then take 4 ounces of peony water or sage water and a spoonful of this powder and incorporate them and give it lukewarm to the patient to drink in the form of a syrup for 2 months continually, more or less, according to how you see improvement. Then the patient should take care of his way of living and life and in a short time, with the aid of God, soon he will be cured of this infirmity, because this has often been tested.
