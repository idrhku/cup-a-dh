Another. If you wish to make other kinds of fragrant waters, distill these leaves, roots and powders. That is, take leaves and tender cuttings of cedar, lemon and orange and first do each separately in the still. Then do another separately of white lilies. Then put in 3 ounces of powdered cloves and 2 ounces of powdered orris root and distill it on a slow fire. If you distill it on the bain marie you will never smell a more soft and delicate odor. These soft odors greatly sustain the memory. When this water is distilled, let it stay in the sun at least 15 to 20 days so that the sun purifies it and augments the odor and it becomes more perfect. Do the experiment and you will find it is true because I made it and it turned out much better than one would expect. Do it and you will see.

Another to make lavender flower water. Take lavender flowers or spike lavender in whatever quantity you want and put them in a glass flask. Put brandy from the third distillation so that the flowers are barely covered and let them stay for at least 2 or 3 days in a warm place. Keep it well-sealed around so that it does not lose its odor. Then put on rose water to cover the flowers at least 4 fingers deep and cover again as before and let this also stay for one whole day. Then put in whole cloves and 2 nutmegs broken up. Put on the lid of the flask and put it in a suitable place to distill with its receptacle below. Seal the joints with linen cloth and with dough so that in distilling no gases escape. Distill with a very slow fire or distill on a bain marie which is better and makes it more odorous. Then when it is distilled, let it stay at least 15 days in the sun. Then put in 2 or 3 grains of musk ground in the usual way. You will have a very odorous water.
