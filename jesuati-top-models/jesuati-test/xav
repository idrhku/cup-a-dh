Take 1 ounce each of galingale, mace and nutmeg, 6 ounces each of ginger and cinnamon, 4 ounces of cultivated cubeb, 3 ounces each of saffron, cloves, lavender and cardamon, 2 ounces of long pepper, and 1 ounce of grains of paradise and make fine powder of all these and use it several times and the catarrh will give you no more trouble.

Use powdered rosemary in your beverages. For one who has much rheum in the head or may spit a lot, put some camomile in lye and with this repeatedly wash your head and it will help a great deal.
