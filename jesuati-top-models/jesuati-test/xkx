Take 2 handfuls each of greater and lesser centaury, honeysuckle, wood sorrel, plantain and ribwort plantain, 1 handful each of comfrey, self heal, mouse ear, clary and tansy, ½ handful each of dill, wormwood and feverfew, 2 ½ ounces each of roots of red madder and ground wheat and 1 ½ handfuls each of flowers and leaves of St. John's wort, agrimony, burdock, toadflax and horsetail. Cut everything as finely as possible, then add in these fats, which are 1 lb. of unsalted pork fat, 2 lb. of fragrant rose oil, 1 ½ lb. each of clear turpentine and beef suet and 1 lb. of mutton fat. Regrind everything together from the beginning and incorporate with 3 lb. of very fragrant wine. Let it stay all together in the sun for 9 to 10 days. Then put it in a pot on a slow fire until the wine is consumed and stir with your rod so that it does not stick on the bottom. Then strain this warm under the press and extract the substance well. Then put it again in the pot on a slow fire. Put therein 8 ounces of very clear turpentine, 3 ounces each of mastic and fresh pine pitch, 2 ounces of elemi gum and enough white wax and make a firm unguent that you can soften with fragrant wine and then with cow's milk or goat's milk and at the end with a little brandy to make a wonderful secret remedy to heal all wounds from the head to the feet, because this unguent has been made from much testing.
