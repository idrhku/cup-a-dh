Take 10 lb. of cistern water, 1 lb. of lees from a charred barrel of yew which held dyes for tinting glass, 3 ounces each of salt and rock alum and Â¼ ounce of sublimate. Grind everything and boil them in a clean pot or carafe. At the end of one hour it will be made. Remove it from the fire, let it cool and strain it. With a sponge bathe with this water for 4 evenings, one yes and the next no, and on the alternate evenings wash with warm lye and change your clothes. Use a clean blanket and you will be cured. When this water is used to bathe it becomes turbid and so when you use it that will happen.

Take 2 fingers of good white wine in a glass and put in a piece of sulfur the size of a bean and not more to infuse. In the morning strain it through fine cloth. Then give it to the sick one to drink and at once he will be cured and many worms will go out. It is tested.
