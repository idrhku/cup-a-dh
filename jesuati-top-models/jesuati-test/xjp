Take 6 ounces each of white wax, pine tar and oil, 3 ounces each of incense, bdellium and milk vetch, 1  each of opoponax gum and aloe, 2 ounces each of gum ammoniac, myrrh and galbanum, 4 ounces of litharge, 1 ½ ounces of turpentine, 2 ½ ounces of sarcocol gum and 2 ounces of verdigris. First put these things to soak in vinegar: the bdellium, opoponax and gum ammoniac and they should be coarsely broken up. Then put the oil in the pot and put in the tar, galbanum, sarcocol and turpentine and make these melt. Then strain it with force. Return it to the fire and put in the 3 gums that you put in the vinegar and add the vinegar itself and bring this to a boil. Then put in these other things, all made into fine powder: litharge, myrrh, aloe, milk vetch and incense and incorporate them well with your spatula. Strain this one more time with a pointed sack with 2 sticks or a split reed, drawing downward so that it quickly extrudes out. Return it to the fire and put in the cut wax and boil slowly until it comes to perfection. Put in the verdigris, finely chopped, and at once remove it from the fire and stir it continuously until it is cold so that the green color is well incorporated and it will be well made, the Apostles' unguent. It will be green. It will rectify fistulas and scrofulas and other sores and it is powerful in ulcers. It removes dead flesh from sores and consolidates them. This is powerful above all other unguents.

Green unguent that heals and closes every wound.
