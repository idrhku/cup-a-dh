Take 1 ½ ounces of white wax, ½ ounce each of pine tar and gum ammoniac, 2 ½ ounces of turpentine, 2 drams of opopanax, 1/2 ounce of verdigris, ½ ounce each of bdellium, milk vetch, incense, myrrh and galbanum, 1 ounce of yellow litharge and 1 ½ lb. of olive oil. Put the oil and yellow litharge in a pot and boil it a little on a slow fire. Put the gums, broken up, to soak in vinegar and strain them when you put them in the pot. Then put in the other things made into powder and let this cook sufficiently, using your ladle, on a slow fire so it does not burn. Before you remove it from the fire put in the verdigris, made very fine, and the wax, cut minutely. Then remove it from the fire and stir until it is cold and it will be made, a perfect unguent. Note that this unguent needs 2 pounds of oil if it is made in the wintertime and 1 ½ pounds in the summer. Some call this the Apostles' unguent. Use it.

Little basic unguent, good and perfect.
