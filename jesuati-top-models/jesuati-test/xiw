Another water that may cure sores on the legs. Take water from a pure fountain and say over it these words. Also it may cure a wound. Wet some cloths in it and put them on the sore in the form of a cross. Then say the Pater Noster and the Ave Maria. 'In the name of the Father, + Son and + Holy Spirit + , Amen. The day of our Lord when he was born, the day of our Lord when he died, the day of our Lord when he was resurrected, the day of our Lord when he went to God, purge, take or remove this sore, heal and stop the bleeding so it will not develop pus, nor infection, nor any other bad illness. God grant that it be so and his mother, the Virgin Mary +. Father, Son and Holy Spirit +. Amen.' Say this 3 times, one after the other, and you will cure the sores.
