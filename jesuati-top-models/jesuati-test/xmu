Another prayer to say against arthritis. Viz. “Christ was walking with the Virgin Mary and on the way they met arthritis and they said, 'Where are you going, pain? Where are you going, you cursed arthritis?' 'I am going to the house of your servant (name) to drink his blood and eat his flesh and afflict his family.' They said, 'You must not go to the house of (name). He is such a good person that you cannot go there but must go to the sea and gnaw rocks and brine that will break you up and remove you before it is tomorrow morning.' In the name of the Father, + Son + and Holy Spirit. + Amen.”

Another prayer against painful arthritis. Viz. “Three angels were walking on Mount Sinai and they met the sickness arthritis and asked and said to it, 'Where are you going?' It answered, 'I am going to torment the nerves and dry and diminish the flesh and reduce the medulla of your servant (name).' 'We invoke through the Father and through the Son and through the Holy Spirit, through the living and true God who is the creator of all creatures, by the 4 evangelists, Matthew, Luke, Mark and John, by the holy Mary, mother of God, by Peter held in bonds, by the person who stayed 3 days in the belly of the whale, by Moses who escaped from the hands of the Pharaoh and by the day of judgment that causes so much fear, that from this hour you will have no mastery over my servant (name) neither to torment his bones, nor dry his flesh, nor even reduce his medulla. Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Immortal.' In the name of the Father, + Son, + and Holy Spirit + and of his glorious Virgin Mary, mother of the Son of God, and of Saint Christopher and Saint Cosimo and Saint Damian and M Saint Leonard and of all the saints of God who are crowned in heaven and adored on earth and canonized in Rome, free your servant (name) from arthritis and all other infirmities, if it is your pleasure, Jesus Christ.' In the name of the Father, + Son + and Holy Spirit. + Amen.”
