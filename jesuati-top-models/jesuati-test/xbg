Another prayer for the falling sickness to carry with you. Viz.: 'God was, God is and God will be. So as the body is lifted, God on high who is the Lord, the consecrated host and the living flesh, as you are the Son of the Virgin Mary, free me, your servant (name), in the name of God and of the Virgin Mary and of Saint Bartholomew and of the Holy Trinity. So be it. Father + Son + Holy Spirit +, Amen.'

Let us pray: 'God who through your Apostle Bartholomew in the temple of Astaroth freed the weak daughter of king Polum from being harassed by demons, may we be worthy, through the merits of his passion, to be freed from the incurable falling sickness and also from all evil, through our Lord, Jesus Christ, your Son.'
