Another. If anyone will carry the right eye of the wolf on him, it has been said that no sorcery will be able to harm him. Neither incantation nor any illness will be able to harm him or come near and he will not be able to sleep as long as he keeps it near him. Also one of these eyes, whichever you want, wrapped in a leaf of the herb called heliotrope, gathered in August when the sun is in the lion, is powerful so that no person will be able to gainsay him while he is carrying it secretly near him.

Another. If you fasten 2 or all 4 canine teeth of the wolf or only one around the neck of a little or large child, no animal will be able to harm him and it protects greatly from worms and saves and defends him so he will not develop that bad illness. The teeth are also used to burnish gold in working it. Also if you grind the molar teeth of the wolf into fine powder and put this this powder at night on the chest of a woman or man who is asleep, she or he will tell you, half asleep, all that she or he has ever done at any time in life, relating more than would otherwise be said.

Another. The blood of the wolf drunk for 9 waning moons, cures the illness of epilepsy.
