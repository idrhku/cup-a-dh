For one who has lost his hearing. Take a squash that has been standing for a long time in oil and roast it and collect the oil that is extracted and put the shed skin of a snake in it and boil it. Put the warm oil in the ear with a little cottonwool and keep it warm. By continuing this, you will be cured. Wash your head with water in which has been cooked roses, camomile, laurel leaves and sweet clover, and when you have washed and dried your head, take bitter almond oil distilled in a glass still and one ounce each of muscardine oil and beaver marrow and put everything together and put some of this warm oil in the ear with piled up cottonwool and soon your deafness will be helped.

Another for problems with the ears. Know that when the spiral of the ear is too full of wax, the result is tinnitus and ringing. At this time one wants to take a loaf of white bread that is just removed from the oven and open it in half and put this on the ear, warm, and then take oil of bitter almonds and warm it and put it in the ear with a stupe or cottonwool and it will be cured.

Another if the ear has boils inside. Put therein wool dipped in the said oil and it will bring out the boil.

Another for one who does not hear. Take the herb savin and common juniper, each the same amount, and cook them in good white wine until they reduce two-thirds and remove them from the fire and hold the ear to the warm steam, because it has such power that the hearing soon opens and it is a great help.

When you have water in the ears or other dampness. Take a new tile and heat it well and put the ear on the tile and the heat will draw forth the water or other dampness that impedes the hearing.

All these are approved. Note that if you put brandy in the ears, it draws out the rheum and helps the brain. If you wash the posterior part of the head, it strengthens the powers of the memory.

Most perfect remedy for one who may be deaf.
