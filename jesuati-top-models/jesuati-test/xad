Another electuary, excellent for the eyesight. Take seed of fennel, bastard lovage, celery seed, parsley and anise seed, 2 ounces each, and some juniper berries, very mature, and also these herbs: eyebright, rue, burdock, celandine, burnet, betony, agrimony, horehound, pennyroyal, rosemary and borage flowers, 3 ounces each, and all these herbs should be made into fine powder, mixed carefully, of which you should take one scruple each time with good wine or broth early in the morning in the form of a syrup. If you should wish to make it into an electuary with good sugar, take Â½ ounce on an empty stomach which will make your eye appear wonderful and clear by continuing it. Keep yourself from adverse things.
