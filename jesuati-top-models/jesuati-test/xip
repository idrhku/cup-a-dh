White lead unguent effective in skin irritation caused by choler adust and salt phlegm and for dry scabies, burns from fire, for erysipelas and for serious burns.

Take 6 drams each of white lead and litharge, 3 drams each of burnt lead and slag from silver and 2 ½ drams each of mastic and frankincense. Then take 1 ½ ounces of rose oil and 1 ounce of rose vinegar and make the solid things into very fine powder and incorporate everything in the mortar, grinding well so they are well mixed. This unguent should be neither too hard nor too soft but sufficiently soft for all the above infirmities. If you wish it for scabies, add in 5 drams of sublimate of mercury made into powder and this removes scabies rapidly. If you will put in 2 ounces of verdigris it will work better for all these infirmities.
