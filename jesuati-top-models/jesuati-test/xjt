Take 1 dram of gum ammoniac, 3 drams each of bdellium, frankincense, mastic, milk vetch and sarcocol gum, 2 drams each of myrrh and galbanum, 1 ½ ounces of yellow litharge, 2 ½ drams each of aloe and opopanax gum, 2 drams of verdigris, 2 ounces of pine tar and 2 ounces of white wax. First soak the ammoniac, bdellium, galbanum and opoponax in strong vinegar, enough to barely cover them and leave them for 6 hours and not more. Put 1 lb. of ordinary oil in a pot and put therein the litharge and make it come to a boil on a slow fire. Then put in the gums that were soaking in vinegar, straining them first. Boil it until the vinegar is consumed. Then put in all the other things, made into fine powder, and at the last the wax and let it boil very little, always stirring so it does not burn. Remove it from the fire and stir until it is cold and it will be made for your use.

Unguent of Avicenna, called the unguent of Venus.
