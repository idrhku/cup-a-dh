Prayer against the gouts to say every morning and carry it with you.

'This is the name of the great power, my Lord God, El, Eloy, Ely, Sabaoth, Elyon, Ele, Adonay, Iathetagramaton, Saday. + Father, Son and Holy Spirit, + Amen. Holy Trinity, one God, have pity, have pity on us. Agyos oteos, agios yschiros, agyos atanatos, eleyson, imas. God be gracious to me a sinner. God incline your ear to me and hear me. Open your eyes and see my trials, pains and infirmities and save me in your mercy. Help me and aid me in my necessity through the reverence and love of the most holy name of your most holy Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ, and by the reverence and love and intercession of the most holy Virgin Mary, his mother, and all your holy saints who live and reign in the world. Amen. Et iot es uau tetagramaton . Lord God save me from the pain of gout and pity me and free me from all my anguish and infirmities, in the name of God the Father, + Son, + and Holy Spirit +, Amen.' Say this in the morning with a Pater Noster.
