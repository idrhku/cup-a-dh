Another unguent for the legs. Take 6 ounces of olive oil, 2 ounces of turpentine, 1 ounce each of red lead, white lead and white litharge and ½ ounce of aloe. Make everything in very fine powder. Put in the oil, turpentine and ½ ounce of clean wax. As it begins to boil on a slow fire, put in the powders, little by little, always stirring with your wooden spatula. When it appears to you that it is cooked, according to the rules, remove it from the fire and it will be made perfect. You can use it to treat at your pleasure.
