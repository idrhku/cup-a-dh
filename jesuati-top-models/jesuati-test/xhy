Another to cure hemorrhoids. Take 1 lb. of rose oil and put it in a little pot on the fire and put therein absinthe, horehound and southernwood, each the same amount, and boil this a little. Then at warm temperature, put these herbs on the hemorrhoids in the form of a plaster. Do this 3 or 4 times a day and put on a warm stupe. Do it several times and you will cure them rapidly. Also take some marrow from the shin bone of veal, an equal amount of butter and some mallow and incorporate these together with powdered incense. Rub the hemorrhoids with this and soon you will lift the pain and you will be cured. Also take some purslane and grind it between 2 stones and put it on the hemorrhoids that exude blood. It stops this soon, removes the pain and cures them.
