Another, a fomentation for fluxes from the body. Take Greek pitch, Armenian clay, mastic, incense, dragon's blood gum, pea pods and pennyroyal, all at your discretion, and put all these things in a pot and boil with violet oil. Put a very large funnel on the pot and put the narrow end in the anus and take the fumes in this way as much as you can and you will be cured.

*For burns from water or fire.

Take peeled onions and grind them in a mortar, however many seem to be enough, and put them on a piece of cloth in the form of a plaster and at once put it where you are burned. Do this until you are cured.

*Another. Take snow and fill a pot and bury it at a depth of half an arm's length in the ground outside, that is in the garden, and at the end of three months it will be made. Remove it and use it until one is cured. Medicate 3 or 4 times a day with wet cloths.
