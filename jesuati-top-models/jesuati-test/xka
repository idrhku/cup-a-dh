Another unguent to regrow tissue. Take 3 ounces of rose oil, 1 ounce of clean wax, 2 drams of saffron, 2 ounces of fir tree oil, ½ ounce of mastic and 1 ½ ounces of myrrh and make fine powder and put all these things in the pot and make them melt so they are incorporated. Strain this warm at once through the strainer. Then put it again in the pot on a slow fire and so it cooks enough but does not burn. Remove it from the fire and stir it for a piece and it will be made. This grows flesh on sores.
