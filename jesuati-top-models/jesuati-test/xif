You should know that the sickness of piles is called the greater hemorrhoids because they are harder to cure and are not the ordinary hemorrhoids. These piles are of minute appearance and grow around the rear area and around the vagina and always stand out and become a color between red and black. They give very great distress and pain and through the bad blood that nourishes them, they itch. When they are touched by rubbing them they cause you pain. Therefore do not deviate from the rules given above so, with the aid of God, you will soon be cured.
