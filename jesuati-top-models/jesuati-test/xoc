Beverage for the French illness, for sciatica and for the cararrhs.

Take some guaiac wood, shaved finely, and 9 ounces of guaiac bark, cut finely, 4 ounces of senna from Levant, 1 dram of rhubarb, 3 lb. each of water of betony, of hops and of barley and good white wine, and 1 handful of the holy thistle as the herb. Put everything together in a large, clean pot with a cover that has a little hole in the center. Seal the cover around the pot so that no gases can escape and put everything to infuse in the evening and let it stay that way all night. In the morning boil it on a slow fire and, if it is possible, without smoke so the water may not take on a bad taste. Boil until it reduces 1/3 and put a little stick in the hole in the cover when it has reached this limit and do not fail to do this. When it is cooked, remove it from the fire and let it cool, covered, and when it is cool, strain it carefully very slowly. Save it in a covered glass flask in a cool place and this is the thing to give as a syrup in the morning. Then refill the pot with cistern water or other soft water and cover it as at first and do as you did before and boil it so it reduces 1/3 and then strain it finely. Save this to give to drink at all meals because for many days one should not drink wine. The material that remains in the pot is of no more use. Throw it away.
