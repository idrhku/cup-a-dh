And say over them this prayer, after a Pater Noster, 'God was born, God was taken, bound, betrayed, afflicted and crucified and died for our miserable sins. God was resurrected on the third day, according to the scripture, and as this is true so this illness cannot decay, nor putrefy, nor cause any pain if it is the pleasure of God and of the Virgin Mary.' Make the sign of the cross over them and soon you will be cured.

Another, an oil for every developing growth. Take a squash that has been in oil, roast it and collect the oil that is distilled through the heat of the fire. Then put some bitter herbs of any kind in this oil and a little bunch of squill bulbs and a few earthworms washed in white wine and a little mastic. Boil everything on a bain marie. Then strain it and press the herbs in the press so that it gives up all the substance into the oil. Hold this oil dear because as it ages, it gains greater power. When you want to rub the developing growth, make it very warm and rub several times and the growth will decrease and truly not progress. You will soon be cured of this illness.

Another to cure the sickness of erysipelas. Say over the sickness the Pater Noster and the Ave Maria and this prayer, viz. + 'In the name of the good Jesus may this sickness not grow more. In the name of Saint Angeletta this sickness is ended. In the name of Saint Anastasia and the glorious Virgin Mary this sickness must go away. Amen.'

*Another good remedy for the salt phlegm. Take 1 ounce each of strained butter and turpentine, the yolk of one fresh egg, juice and pulp of one orange, 10 grains of saffron and make an unguent. Rub the sick person with this in the evening when he goes to sleep, using the unguent warm.
