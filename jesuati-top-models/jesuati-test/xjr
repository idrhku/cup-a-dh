Another strong unguent. Take 3 glasses of malvasia wine, 3 ounces each of saltpeter, rock salt, dried rock alum, one glass of strong vinegar and 2 ounces of fine verdigris and make this boil until it reduces in half. Then take 5 ounces of oil of balsam with powdered orris root and compound them with 1 dram of pine tar, 1 ounce of turpentine, 1 Â½ ounces of clean wax and enough fine powder of balsam leaves, that is the balsam apple, so the composition becomes somewhat green. When it seems to you to be cooked, take it from the fire and stir until it becomes cold and it will be made, a perfect and good unguent. Few know its virtue.

The golden unguent cures, grows flesh, consolidates and heals any fresh wound.
