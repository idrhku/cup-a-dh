Splash a drop of milk from the right breast of the woman in a glass of clear, cool water and another drop from the left breast in another glass at 5 months, 7 months and 9 months of pregnancy. If you see that the drop that falls in the first glass goes to the bottom and the center part stays in a clump and then floats up but stays tightly together, you will judge that the baby will be male. When the milk splits apart or spreads on the water smoothly, judge that the baby will be female. Then do the same with the second glass of cool water with milk from the left breast. See if the 2 signs are confirmed. If the drop goes to the bottom you will say male and if the drop spreads you will say it is female. Try this other sign. If the gravid woman is upright on her feet, call her and watch well which foot she puts first before the other. If she puts the right foot forward first, it is a male in her body and her body will be pointed toward the front. If she puts the left foot first, judge the baby to be female and she will not be as pointed in front but will be greater toward the sides. These tests have been tried many times and for the most part have come out correctly and it holds that they are tested.
