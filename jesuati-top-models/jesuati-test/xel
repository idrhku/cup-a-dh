Another enema to cure diarrhea rapidly. Take the shin bone and parch it and make fine powder of it and cook it in water. Then take some of this boiled water and put in one ounce each of rose and violet oils and mastic oil and add the yolk of a fresh egg and make the enema. If this helps, do it again until the body has had a good result and feels good and, through God's grace, soon you will cure.
