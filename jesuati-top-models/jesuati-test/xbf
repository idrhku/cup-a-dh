We pray, 'Gracious and most high omnipotent God as we honor the holy day of your Saints Cosmas and Damian, may we be free from all threatening evils by their intercessions, through our Lord, Jesus Christ. Gaspar brought myrrh, Melchior brought incense, Balthasar brought gold.' Do this on Thursday or Sunday and say the Mass of the Three Kings and make 3 gifts of 3 kinds with this second prayer.
