Another for diarrhea. Take some mint, powdered cloves, mastic, nutmeg, strong vinegar and malvasia wine, all these things at your discretion, and make a poultice of all these things and make it warm and put it on the body. If you suspect there are worms, put therein Â½ ounce of powdered aloe and you will cure rapidly. Be confident since it is tested.
