Also if you have a cask of wine that has turned and was clear, at once change it to another clean barrel that does not have a bad odor. For each barrel of wine put in 4 ounces of 16 carat brandy. When you have it all decanted, mix it in the barrel with a stick of willow and put in one leaf of clary and no more, tied with a string that goes half way down the barrel. Fasten it and let it stay for at least 4 or 5 days. Then take it out and do not infuse it more. This wine can be drunk and will not offend anyone. This has been tested.

Note that brandy that has been distilled 3 times will be from 18 to 24 carats. This is not good to drink, as has been said. But it is good to bathe the head, the forehead, the eyes and the nose for one who suffers from coldness and when the person has a annoying cold in the head that involves the eyes and from that the distress of coughing. In the evening when you go to bed, put a little on your hand and wet the forehead and the head in front and behind on the neck. Do this 3 or 4 times. Then cover your head with a night cap or other little cap or with a head towel and cover it well so it stays warm. Then raise both hands to the nose and draw up in the nose the odor that will go to your brain and comfort it greatly. You will sleep well in the night and in the morning you will be more than half cured. Do this the next evening and you will be completely cured. When a person has washed and dried the head and that evening rubs the head with this brandy and keeps it from any humidity, it will make the hair soft and delicate.
