The second way is by suffocation of the natural warmth, caused by humidity and watery putrefaction. Certainly we see such humidity gathered in our body and especially in the head through which swellings are generated in the throat. This illness is called quinsy from which some die. Sometimes heavy catarrh accumulates from which humans may quickly suffocate. Sometimes humidity causes deafness and damage in the head with accumulation of fluid in the eyes and great dullness, paralysis and epilepsy.

The third cause is because worms are generated from bad humors through putrefaction. They may come to the upper parts of the body and make painful lesions until they make the body come into syncope from which it may not recover. If the condition is not helped, the person may soon die from the pain and also from the toxic fumes arising from the bad humors that break up and destroy the vital spirits.

*Oil of tartar from wine casks, made by me, Friar Antonio of Spain.

The man who loses blood by blood-letting in order to gain health.

These things are agreeable for health. First, good bread of grain, well raised with yeast and well cooked, a little light wine to drink that does not fill up the stomach, eggs, fish that come from rocky places and meat of young pig or mutton or other young animals, of kid and pullet, and the little apples that are found at this time. But do not eat cabbages of any sort because they generate poisons in the stomach, nor cheese nor anything cooked with it. So say Galen and Hippocrates in 64 aphorisms in the fifth particular. It is a very bad thing to give milk to the feverish or to those who are suffering pain. On the day that blood is drawn, one must not sleep because through sleep a kind of little fever arises that makes the person develop syncope, that is depression of the heart or dimness of vision in such a way that in some it causes distress, that is swooning.
