Take one quatrino each of hepatic aloe and raw honey and a little Roman pellitory, licorice, hyssop and barley, each the same amount. Then put everything in a large pot full of water and boil it at least until all are cooked. Then remove it from the fire and strain it and press it very well to get all the substance. Then take a little of it warm, one evening yes, the next no, and you will see a wonderful effect in cleaning out this infirmity by spitting out a large amount of catarrhal material which is very hard on the stomach. The spitting out that you will do will cure you quickly. It is tested.
