Another for the pain that comes to a horse through overheating or overcooling. Note that when you go to the midnight mass of Christ's birth which is called the mass of Saint Anastasia, + when the priest says the Pater Noster, say it with him with all deference. When you want to help a horse, put your hands to the right ear and say 3 Pater Noster with 3 Ave Maria and make 3 crosses in honor of the Holy Trinity and Saint Anastasia in commemoration of that mass you heard on the night when you said the Pater Noster with the the priest. Then make a good bed for the horse and do not worry for soon it will be cured.

The horse that has a cough or is cold or is broken-winded.

Take 6 radish roots, 6 ounces of butter, 4 heads of garlic and Â½ ounce of pepper. Everything should be ground finely and incorporated together. Early each morning give the horse some of it to eat, as much as an egg each time, for 15 days, and at once put the bit in his mouth and leave it there for 2 or 3 hours so he does not eat. Then give him his bran mash and nothing more and soon he will be cured. Keep him warm in his stall with his cover. This has been tested.

Another to cure the broken-winded horse. Take a measure of barley that is free of powder and dirt and boil it with enough water until the barley cracks. Then remove it and press out the barley in the press and put this substance with the boiled water. Put in 1 handful of nettles and 2 handfuls of the herb juniper, cut finely, and return everything to boil together a little. Then with dexterity give this boiled liquid to the horse to drink for 10 to 15 days and it will be cured. Keep the horse warm. Boil with the barley a half pound of lard from a young male pig.
