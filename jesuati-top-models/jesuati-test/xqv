Another prayer. Make the sign of the holy cross and say, 'If you call me, permit fear and trembling to go away in the strength of your arm. Lord, may they be made as immovable as stone until your servant (name) whom you possess passes the constant enemy who guards the entrance. + Iota + sita + exitula +. With the sign of the holy cross I will pass by securely. + As Jesus passed through the multitude, so will I go before and go through the midst of them. + + + .' Carry this with you and God will aid you. Have faith that he will aid you in every peril.
