When using these pills you will find other properties that I am not writing down because the above list has been many, many times tested by me, Master Apothecary Andrea from Farre in Brescia, and by other persons worthy of belief. Be well.

Imperial pills with some of their virtues.

Take 1 dram each of grains of paradise, anise, mastic, cardamon, ginger and fine rhubarb, and take succotrine aloe in weight to all of these. In winter these are compounded with syrup of eupatorium and in summer with violet syrup. Make a paste and from this make little pills in the form of chick peas. Take 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 a week without fasting or any preparation.
