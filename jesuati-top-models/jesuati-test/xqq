Take one green apple or other odoriferous apple per barrel of wine, cut it in 4 parts and remove only the parts with the seeds. Thread the rest on a string and put them in the wine about 4 fingers from the bottom. Cover the cask well and in a few days the bad odor will disappear. But first transfer the wine to another vessel so it will recover quickly. Likewise, put in a sour orange cut across into 2 parts. Put them on a string and do as is said above, one per barrel. This has been tested. Also put in 2 or 3 leaves of clary, that is common clary, and it will give a very good and elegant odor. If you boil 4 leaves of the above-mentioned herb in a vat of wine, it gives it the odor of muscatel. This has been tested.

Another to remove mold from wine and the vessel. Take 2 ounces of zedoary per cask, made into powder, and put it in a little sack and put it in the wine 4 fingers from the bottom. Leave it for 30 days and the wine will be restored.

Another to remove mold from wine. Make a cake of millet flour and when it is cooked, still very warm, at once put it in the wine that has mold and close it. Leave it this way and do it several times and the mold will go away.
