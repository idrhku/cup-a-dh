Very worthy unguent to clear up the legs.

Take ½ ounce of bear fat, 2 ½ drams each of vulture fat, chicken fat and mutton fat, 4 ounces of rose oil, 2 drams each of wild olive, mummy and marsh mallow, 2 ounces of clean wax, 4 drams each of pine tar, linseed oil, Armenian red clay, white lead and rotten stone, 10 seeds of round pepper, 1 ½ drams each of camphor, mastic and incense and 1 dram of dragon's blood gum. First take all the fats and cut them finely, melt them and strain them through muslin. Return them to the pot and put therein rose oil and linseed oil and incorporate them well with the fats. Then remove the pot from the fire and while it is warm put therein the mummy, the dragon's blood gum, tar, Armenian red clay, white lead, incense, rotten stone, pepper, wild olive, marsh mallow and at the end the wax. All the above things are made into fine powder. Return it to the fire and reboil very slowly and stir continuously with your spatula. When it is cooked, restrain everything with care, passing it warm through muslin. Then put in the camphor, cut minutely, and stir until it is cold and it will be made. Put it away for your needs. You will be able to use this on strips of leather or chamois and let it stay on the sore place for 3 or 4 days. Then change it and do this for 10 to 12 days and you can use other unguents that will make flesh grow rapidly. Watch what you eat. Do not eat harmful things and soon, with the aid of God, you will be cured.
