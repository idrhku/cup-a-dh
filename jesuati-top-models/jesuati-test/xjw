Take 1 ounce of opopanax gum, ½ ounce of lint shavings from old and clean linen cloth, 1 ½ ounces each of good white wine, rose oil and myrtle oil and ½ ounce each of litharge, aloe, sarcocol gum and myrrh. Make an unguent in the mortar without fire, grinding each well by itself. Then put all together, incorporating with the oil and the wine until it is sufficiently in the form of a good unguent, blending now wine, now oil. Some add 2 drams pulverized copper sulfate, compounding this little by little in the mortar until it is really the way you wish and it will be made.
