Take 6 ounces of the root of greater comfrey, cleaned and mashed, 1 ½ ounces each of cypress nuts and myrtle, ½ ounce each of Greek pitch, gum arabic and tragacanth, 1 ounce each of Armenian red clay and dragon's blood gum, 5 drams of mastic, 2 ounces of mummy and 3 lb. of cleaned honey. Make all of the above things into very fine powder and incorporate them with the honey and put in a little rabbit skin, cut very finely, and boil these and incorporate on a slow fire, stirring continuously with a ladle so it does not stick to the bottom. When it has body enough to be in the form of an electuary, remove it from the fire and save it in a vessel for your needs. When you want to use it for one sick with a rupture, give the amount of a nut in the evening when he goes to sleep and in the morning ½ hour before he arises. Give not less than a nut but rather more, especially in the morning. This will aid you greatly in curing.

Do not stop wearing the truss with the plaster on and watch carefully how you live and be careful of all the other things described above, if you wish to be cured soon.
