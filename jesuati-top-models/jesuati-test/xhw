Another to cure hemorrhoids well and quickly. Take old butter, 2 cockroaches and enough rose oil and boil it very slowly until nearly one-half remains. Rub with this very warm and soon it will lift your pain and you will be cured. It is said that one should take 3 lb. of verjuice and 1 lb. of copper sulfate and boil this until it reduces 1/3 and wash repeatedly with this as a warm bath and soon the hemorrhoids shrink and are cured.
