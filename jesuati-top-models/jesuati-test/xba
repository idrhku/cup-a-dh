Another for epilepsy. Take the herb dragon root or its seed or root or some of its berries and some of its juice and give it to the patient to drink several times and he will see the effect. Then take some peony root, gathered during the half-moon in autumn and also some of its seed gathered in the waning moon and make very fine powder of all. Take some of the powder you have made above from the head of a man or a woman and also take some fur of a white dog and cut it very finely and blend everything together. Give the sick one a spoonful of this powder in broth or in soup or in any way as long as he takes it and, with the aid of God, shortly you will see him cured. See that he does not know the composition of the powder so that he more willingly will take it and, through the faith that he has to be cured, he will be cured without fail.
