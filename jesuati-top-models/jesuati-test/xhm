Take 1 handful each of the herb greater sedum, agrimony and leaves of the balsam apple and boil them in Â½ lb. of oil of roses with 3 ounces of plantain water on a slow fire until it reduces 1/3. Then strain it and squeeze the herbs under the press and extract the substance as much as you can and put that with the oil and it will be made, a precious oil to cure hemorrhoids at your need. When the hemorrhoids give you trouble, take a little in an egg shell and make it very warm and with a chicken feather rub them very well inside and out 2 or even 3 times a day and you will be cured. If you wish to be cured rapidly, before you oil yourself, take a laxative the day before and it should be the ordinary kind to drink and it should be cooling. You should take this kind of laxative for all problems of hemorrhoids and also in piles. Take care of your life and do not eat things that are warming, nor sour things, nor salted meat, but all things cooling. Then after your ointments, I say that, with the aid of God, soon you will be cured. They will not give you more trouble and by following the prescriptions and the rules above, you will soon be cured.
