Also you can add other tubs, as many as can go around with the flasks inside and they will all distill with one fire if the tubes continue to carry warm water to the tubs and it distills. Put in the bottom of the tub one of those tripods, as you see, with those holes covered around with cloth or tow so that the bottom of the pot or flask sits on it securely without fear of breaking. Do it in a way that the flask is firm in the water without moving. When you see the distillate change, remove the receptace first, then its cover. Then remove your flask or pot and with dexterity remove the dregs and put in another that you want. Then return it as it was at first with its cover on and well closed with the receptacle below. With this fire you will be able to make the change 2 times a day and you will draw off a great amount of water. This water carries with it the odor and the flavor of the herbs or flowers. Whatever kinds of flowers or herbs are used, you will know by the taste of the water which kind of herb or flower it is.

This kind of water distilled in this way in the bain marie is much praised over all the other distillations of waters as being very suited to our nature. It is praised by doctors and expert physicians because, made in this way, it does not take on bad odors of any kind because the heat is continually temperate and never fails from the charcoal in the tower. As described above, the heat is always obtained when it is needed so that in the night it continues to distill and there is no danger that the water will not come out clear and beautiful.
