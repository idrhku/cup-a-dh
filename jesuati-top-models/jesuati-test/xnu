Another. Make ashes of twigs of grape vines and pass them through a sieve and make some lye from most of this. Then take equal amounts of this lye and vinegar and ordinary old oil and urine from a little child of 6 years and put everything together. Put it in a clean vessel and boil it very slowly until it is reduced in half. Then put in the fine ashes that you have reserved, little by little, until it takes on the body of a liquid unguent. Let it boil a little, stirring continuously. Then add 1 ounce of clean wax. Remove it from the fire and stir until it is cold and it will be made. The sick person should go to bed and the hard spleen should be rubbed with the warm ointment. Put on warm stupes and cloths and bind them on well. Do this every evening until you feel yourself improved. Watch what you eat. It is that which hurts you and keeps you sick.

Take leaves and roots of ferns and asparagus, each the same amount. Cook them in cistern water and give it to drink warm. By continuing this, the spleen will be dried up.
