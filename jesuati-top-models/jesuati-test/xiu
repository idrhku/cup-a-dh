Take 2 ounces each of oil of violets and of sweet almonds, butter, chicken fat, fat from badger and goose and ox marrow and white wax, 1 ounce each of laurel oil, theriac and mutton fat, 1 ½ ounces each of oil of lavender, of dill, of camomile and of mastic, and 2 drams each of nutmeg, cloves, fine cinnamon and cubebs. Note that all the fats should be cut, melted and strained and then incorporated with the oils. Make all the other things into very fine powder. First put the oils and the fats on a slow fire, then the butter, theriac and the spices and last the wax and incorporate everything on a little fire for a half hour. Then remove it from the fire and continue to stir until it is cold, and it will be made. Hold it as something dear because the unguent is good for many illnesses, especially for nerves retracted by cold and for blows and bruises and stabs and other ailments of the body. When it is rubbed on it should be warm and soon you will have a cure.

Another very worthy unguent for the legs. Take 1 ounce each of white lead and litharge, ½ ounce of white coral, 2 drams each of zinc oxide and camphor and 1 ½ ounces each of white wax, rose oil, strong white vinegar and plantain juice. Put the oil, vinegar and juice in a pot on the fire and boil it on a slow fire until the juice is consumed. Then put in the wax and as it melts, remove it from the fire and put therein, little by little, all the other things that were made into fine powder and incorporate them. Then stir continually until it is cold and it will be made. Save it for your needs and it will bring you honor.

Another unguent for the legs. Take ½ ounce of chicken fat, 1 ounce each of butter, goat dung and oil of camomile, 3 ½ drams each of oil of St. John's wort and ground cinnabar, and some spider web. Incorporate everything on a slow fire and let it boil a little and it will be made. Strain it and save it and treat with it.
