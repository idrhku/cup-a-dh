How to decant wines if you wish to preserve them sound all year.

This is the way to decant wines so that during the year they will not spoil and so they will not turn and become acid. Change your wine when the north wind reigns and not at other times and when the moon is waning. If you change it in the waxing moon, it is in great danger of turning and becoming harsh. Be warned about this. You want to change wines that grow in dry, rocky, arid and hilly places at Christmas and other wines right after the feast day of any saint. When these wines are decanted, you want the moon to be gone or nearly at its end. Watch that you do not decant wines when roses and especially grape vines are blossoming, because this would put you in great peril. You should know that the more times you decant wines, the weaker they become, because they always lose some substance that they had at first. When you want to preserve soundness, make sure they stay in a cool place in the summertime and in the winter in a warm pantry. That is, you decant wine into warm or cool pantry according to the temperature. By keeping to this rule, your wines will always be well preserved.
