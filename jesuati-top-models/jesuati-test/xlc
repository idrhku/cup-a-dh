Also make this other unguent. Take 1 Â½ lb. of rose oil, 2 lb. of yellow litharge, 8 ounces of white lead and 6 ounces of clean wax. First put the oil and the wax on the fire and melt them, then the finely-powdered white lead on a slow fire and continue stirring with the rod and when it has boiled enough, put in the litharge and incorporate well until it is cooked. Remove it from the fire and put in 6 scruples of camphor, cut very minutely, and stir until it is cold. The perfect unguent will be made, good for every illness of the knee. It has been tested.

*For fissure or cracks of the lips.

Take hairs from the tail of a horse and bran and put them in a heated iron pan and stir until it reduces to powder. Then take equal amounts of egg white, tragacanth and gum arabic and mix them with the powder. Bring it into the form of an unguent and rub the fissures or cracks on the lips. Putting on this unguent also restores the down of the beard or hairs that appear white among the gray.

*Oil extracted from the kernels of roasted nuts heals wonderfully. Also powdered egg shells mixed with honey heal best.
