Take these kinds of distilled waters: water of oak leaves, of sorb apples, of knot grass, of pine nuts, of liverwort, of cornelian cherry, of myrtle or rose water, each the same amount, and heat it and give 3 ounces of it to the sick person to drink, then 4 ounces, then 5 ounces and at the end give 6 ounces when the flow is so severe that it does not want to stop. Do all this 4 times in one day and you will see a marvelous effect. This beverage will reduce the red menstruation marvelously so that no more will come. It has been tested faithfully. If by chance the flow may not have stopped from the body, give it for 2 days and do the usual enema with oil of camomile. If she takes care of herself you will cure her soon, with the aid of God. Be sure of it.

Another to stop the red menstruation of a woman. Take some hair from the sick one and bind it around any tree that you wish with a Pater Noster. Then make this beverage: take 3 ounces each of parched deer horn and fresh anise, both made into very fine powder and give one ounce of it to drink in the evening in warm red wine for 5 or 6 evenings and she will soon be cured and put in Â½ ounce of broad beans. It has been proved that it stops the flow.

Another to reduce red menstruation. Take linen fiber used for thread and cook it in the usual way, that is on the ashes, and in the evening when you go to sleep steam the vagina with the vapors and put one of these skeins as warm as you can bear on the pubis and the other opposite on the buttocks and wrap them well. Then go to sleep. Do this 2 or 3 evenings and soon you will be cured. Take care of yourself and you will be cured.
