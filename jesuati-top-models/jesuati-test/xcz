Another prayer against fever. Viz., “When Christ put his foot on the wood of the holy cross all the world trembled +. The unbeliever said, 'What ails you, Christ, that you tremble? + Do you have a fever?' + 'Never do I have it.'” Say these words with devotion + and carry them on you, 'Through my love + you will never have fever +, neither quotidian + nor tertian + nor quartan +. Christ is born +, Christ suffered and was resurrected from death +, Christ conquers +, Christ rules +, Christ commands +, Amen +. Lord Jesus Christ, free your servant (name) from all fever and from all evil of the body, Amen. So be it. So be it. So be it. Amen.' Memorize and say it in the ear of the patient and write it down on a little paper and put it around the neck. This is powerful in women's sickness and for mother's ills. With 5 Pater Noster attach it to the father or the mother of a little child and soon you will cure the sick one. It is tested.

Another to remove fever very quickly. You who have the fever, get up at dawn and go out in the clear air and on your knees say the Pater Noster with the Ave Maria and say this, viz., 'Tertian fever, quartan fever and fever of any day, you must leave me as the dawn becomes the day + + +.' Say it 3 times in the morning and for 3 mornings in a row. It is tested.
