Tested prayer against tertian fever. Take 3 leaves of sage and eat one each morning and on the first have written these words, 'Christ is peace,' on the second 'Christ is rest,' and on the third 'Christ is the perfect remedy. It is done.' Say 3 Pater Noster each morning and eat the leaf with devotion. Keep yourself from irregular ways and the tertian fever will not come again. Likewise you can write these other words, that is, on the first leaf, 'Christ is born,' on the second, 'Christ conquers,' on the third, 'Christ suffered.' Or another time when there may be tertian, write on the first leaf, 'Christ rules,' the second, 'Christ was resurrected,' the third, 'Christ orders,' and all the tertian fever will go away. This is tested.

Prayer against fever. “Saint Peter was sitting in front of the gate of Galilee and he had fever. Lord Jesus came and said to him, 'Peter, why are you lying here?' 'Lord, I am full of fever.' 'I constrain you fever at once, tertian, quartan, quotidian, by the living God and by him who has power over all things, so you do not have power to harm this person, the servant (name) of God.' Lord, in your name, heal me, and by your goodness free me, your child (name), from this fever and from every other illness. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.”
