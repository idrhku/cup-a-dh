Another to cause a sore place to maturate. Take olive oil, wheat flour, flax seed flour, 2 scruples of saffron and lard and boil these on a little fire, stirring continuously so that it does not stick or burn. Then put it on a cloth and put it on the sore or on the swelling and you will make the sore maturate rapidly.
