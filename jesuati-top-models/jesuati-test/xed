Another, a marvelous ointment against worms. Take ½ ounce each of mastic and hepatic aloe and 3 drams each of colocynth and myrrh and make very fine powder of them. Then take 1 handful of this and dry it in the oven when bread is removed. Grind it and make fine powder. Then take 1 lb. of ordinary oil, the oldest you can find, and half a glass of absinthe juice and 2 ounces of petroleum oil. Put the petroleum oil with the olive and boil this for the space of 3 Pater Noster and then put in the above powder, little by little, always stirring, and let it boil for ½ hour. Then put in as much clean wax as a nut and it will be made. Then rub the patient who suffers from worms. It should be warm and rub the top of the stomach and the chest as far as the navel and do not miss it. Rub the kidneys, all the wrists, the temples, the nares of the nose and soon, with the aid of God, the patient will be cured. It has been tested.

*Another for round worms or worms. Make the sign of the holy cross on the forehead of the infant and say three Pater Noster and these words in the right ear of the infant, 'Saint Job had worms and Saint Job was freed and the worms were dead. Man was created and brought forth. The Lord God is strong and powerful.' In the ear or in the mouth say 3 times, ' Galba, gabella, gabellatum est jospes mortes vermes,' and you will cure this sickness immediately.

*Water for scabies.
