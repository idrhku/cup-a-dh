Take 1 ounce of betony, ½ handful of burnet saxifrage, 1 handful of burdock, 3 ounces of good turpentine, 2 ounces each of thick pine tar and clean wax, 1 ½ ounces of tragacanth, 1 ounce each of liquid storax and mastic and 1 ½ ounces of mountain mint. Take all the herbs and cut them very minutely and then grind them very well and put them to soak in 4 lb. of good white wine. Boil this until it reduces in half. Then restrain the wine. Those herbs that are large and are not able to pass through the strainer, regrind very finely until they can. Then return this to the fire and put in the tar, wax, tragacanth and mastic. Everything should be powdered and the tar should be well cleaned. Make it boil enough, slowly, and stir continuously so it does not burn. Before you remove it from the fire when it is cooked, put in the storax and the turpentine and at once strain it one more time and do it at once so that it is hot, in a pointed sack, pressing with 2 sticks back and forth, or use a slotted cane and grasp it with the hands, one at each end, and draw downward very slowly. Soon all will come out so that nothing remains in the sack. Continue stirring with the stick so all is well incorporated and when it is cold it will be made, the most perfect unguent, good for any wound, bruise or blow on the leg or on the body. It does not sting at all and where it enters, it cures rapidly and you will use it with honor. It has been tested.

The Egyptian unguent, powerful for old sores and fistulas that have need of assistance. It cleans, removes dead flesh and putrefaction at the same time.
