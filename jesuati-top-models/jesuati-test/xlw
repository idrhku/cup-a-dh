Be sure that these 2 eggs are layed on the correct day and write on them the words above. First say the Pater Noster and the Ave Maria and on the day of the Holy Spirit say a mass and bless them. Mark the rupture or hernia with these 2 eggs and first say the Pater Noster. Then say over them the above words 3 times in a row for 3 mornings and on the third morning, break one of the 2 eggs and drink it raw with a Pater Noster and the sign of the cross. Then urinate in the egg shell and close it up with wax or glue and put it in a hole in the wall and let it stay until it becomes dry. Tie the other egg with a thread and make a hole in the earth, at least as deep as an arm, where the east wind blows or where the sun reflects well. Lower it in the pit and put over it a little bowl so it will not be broken and do nothing more. Then cover it with earth and continue as before. Let it stay and when the egg is completely dry, you will be cured of the rupture. If the egg rots, it is that God has not cured you. This test has been done three times that I know of and two were well cured of the rupture.

For the gassy hernia that comes low in the scrotal sac.
