To cure piles, that is large hemorrhoids.

Take a good group of snails, that is snails that are large and good, and put them in a pot and put it in the oven and dry them thus completely until you can make very fine powder of them, both the shells and the flesh. Then take 2 ounces each of water of roses, of myrtle, of plantain, of nightshade, of purslane and of house leek and 2 ½ ounces of old, washed butter. Make ashes of one head of garlic and put in 1 ounce of this and ½ ounce of powdered incense and a little ground salt and incorporate these with 6 ounces of the above powder. Then wet some linen cloths and put them on the piles 3 or 4 times a day and by continuing this, soon you will be cured. But you will not be cured so rapidly if first you do not purge yourself and cool yourself well with distilled waters or syrups with muccaro rosato , although senna is better. Be careful of the way you live for 3 or 4 days. Do not drink wine but drink barley water. Do not eat salted vegetables, nor wheat, nor salted meat and all those things that are harmful. Take care of yourself and you will soon be well.
