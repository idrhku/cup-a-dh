Before you leave the house to take a journey, say these holy words with devotion and carry them with you. Viz. First make the sign of the holy cross and say, 'Purity of Christ deliver me. + Christ is goodness. + Christ deliver me + from adversity. + Blood of Christ deliver and guard me. + Passion of Christ deliver me, your servant, Amen.'

Say the following prayer with devotion and you will go in safety. 'In the strength of your arm that which I fear is removed. Your strength is a rock as your people pass by. So Lord Jesus passed through the multitude and no one apprehended him. May their eyes be darkened. May they neither see nor think evil and may their backs be turned. Amen. +'
