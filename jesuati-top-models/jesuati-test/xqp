If you have weak wine and suspect that it will not last to the end of the year in the casks, put therein 4 ounces of brandy from the second distillation in each barrel and not less. By the power of the brandy, you will preserve it and augment the odor and taste that is always good. Also if you put in some tamarind flowers, that also preserves it, but be careful that the flowers are not spoiled. If you want to give a good odor to the wine, put therein some juniper wood cut in pieces, not too small, and put it in the must when it is boiling and it will take on the odor you wish.

Another to give the wine the odor of muscatel. Take flowers of clary or honeysuckle, in whatever amount you want, and dry it in the shade and make powder. Put this powder in a little sack of linen cloth and put it in the cask of musk so that it is a palm's distance from the bottom and attach a small stone. Close the cask for 9 days and when you pull up the sack the wine will smell like muscatel and it will be good. You can do this with other wines, using any kind of fruit.

To remove rapidly the odor of mold or other bad odor.
