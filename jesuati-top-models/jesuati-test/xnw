Prayer to wear around the neck for one who suffers from sickness of the spleen. First say 3 Pater Noster with 3 Ave Maria. Then write this prayer and carry it fastened around the neck with thread spun by a virgin girl. These are the words, viz. 'In the name of the Father +, Son +, and Holy Spirit +, Amen. + gc,gc,gc,v,g,d,gc,gc,di,di,gc,gc,gc,ver,v,v,v . There is neither a monument nor glory except through the most holy and great God + + +.' Do this with confidence that you will soon be cured. Here is another similar to the above which cures the spleen when carried with you. Write in the way given above, viz. 'a,c,c,c,di,di, di,j,ver,v,v' and after that write the same words, 'There is neither a monument nor glory except through most holy and great God + + + .' If you wish to test this prayer, attach it to the neck of an animal and leave it for 9 days. Then kill it and you will not find a spleen in the body, so much will it have shriveled up and diminished. But you know that at this time you should be careful how you live.

Another to cure the spleen. When you first see the new moon, take a pointed knife and sign three times with the point over the spleen and let the knife fall to earth. Each time you make the sign say this holy prayer, viz. '+ Holy moon that shines before the highest Father, dry up the spleen that is in my body as you did the herb in the garden of the Pharisee. In the name of the Father +, Son + and Holy Spirit +. Amen.' When you are ready to begin, say 5 Pater Noster with 5 Ave Maria in reverence to God and the 5 wounds of Jesus Christ. Do this at the start of the new moon for 3 lunar months in a row. Be careful when the new moon begins to say the above prayer and touch the swelling with the point of the knife and you will be cured.
