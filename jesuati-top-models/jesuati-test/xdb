'Lord, free your servant from the pain of tertian or quartan fever, just as you freed Peter and Paul from imprisonment and Susanna from false charges. When Jesus was coming out of the temple and was entering into the house of Simon, the mother-in-law had a great fever and they implored him for her. Standing over her, he sent the fever away and she recovered immediately and attended to them. Jesus is the king. So be it. Jesus + Jesus + Amen.' Carry this prayer with you and it will cure you rapidly.

Another. Take the gall nut from the oak and see that you find therein a spider. Attach the gall nut to your neck with the spider alive and when the spider is dead, the fever will go away and will not return.

Prayer against fever.
