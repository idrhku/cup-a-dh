Take 1 handful each of the inner bark of the ash tree and hyssop and ½ handful of broken up laurel berries. Boil everything in very strong white vinegar until it is reduced 1/3 or ½. Wet pieces of felt or wool cloth or sponge in the boiled liquid and press them out with the hand. Put it on the indurated spleen of the sick person as warm as one can stand and as soon as the place has cooled a little, put another thereon. Do this for an hour or more in the evening and the morning for at least 4 to 6 days in a row and you will see a very good result. Then make these poultices. Rub the indurated spleen with the above ointment and bind the body well with a stupe and warm cloth. If you want to be cured quickly, know how to take care of your life by not eating those things that one may desire in this sickness because one always desires adverse things. Avoid these things especially: do not eat soups, nor sour fruit, nor spicy food, nor pork meat, but eat all things good, such as well-cooked bread and things twice-baked such as veal meat, light and with little bones, or fresh eggs or a little wine. Do not drink too much water which is very bad. By observing this, with the aid of God, soon you will be cured.

A good wine to drink for the indurated spleen and other beverages.

Take 1 handful each of fern roots and sticks of willow and ash or elm and scrape off the bark finely and the bark of crab apple, and three oranges. Boil everything in white wine until it is reduced at least 1/3. Then strain it and save it in a glass flask in a cool place. Use this decoction to drink early in the morning in the form of a warm syrup. It will help you greatly in hardness of the spleen.

Another wine against the painful spleen. Take some plowman's spikenard and boil it with wine. Then drink this boiled liquid in the morning in the form of a syrup as described above. If you drink some of the juice for 9 mornings in a row, you will soon be cured of pain in the spleen.
