Another prayer against fever. Viz., Saints Gosimo and Damian prayed to the Lord that whoever carried these names would be cured of fevers 4, 3 or 2 and in the future: 'Lord Jesus + Christ free your servant (name) of all fever through these sacred names of God, Agios , Yschiros , Athenatos, E leyson , Amen. Pater Eleyson + Yscheros, 2 Eleyson + Athanatos, 3 Eleyson , Amen. Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.' Write this down and below write the name of the sick person. Over this say a mass for these saints and say 5 Pater Noster and attach it around the neck. It is certain you will cure.
