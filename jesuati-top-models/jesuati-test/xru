*Viz. Very well tested ointment for all parts of the body. Take the roots of marsh mallow and of dwarf elder, seeds of St. John's wort and heads of lilies and cut everything finely and put it in olive oil for 5 days. Cook them in this oil and cook them well. Then strain this boiled liquid and again put it on the fire with 1 ounce of wax and 6 ounces of butter and the marrow of ass, of bear, of fox, of badger, of duck and of chicken. Make the ointment of everything in the usual way and use this warm. It will help you greatly.

*To remove redness from the face. Take 2 ounces of yellow sulfur and 1 ounce each of Greek pitch and naval pitch and liquify them in a pot. Add male pork fat until an unguent is formed and the redness should be rubbed with that in the evening when one goes to sleep. In the morning the mouth should be washed with a mouthful of the water and soon the redness will be cured.
