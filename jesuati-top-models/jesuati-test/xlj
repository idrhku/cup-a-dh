*For one who has a problem with the penis from overheating. Take 4 dinari of hepatic aloe, 1 scruple of zinc oxide and enough rose oil to make an unguent. Then spread this on a linen cloth and put it on the penis. When it is irritated inside add a little burnt rock alum.

*Lavage for the penis swollen and excoriated within. Take half a glass of fine white wine and 1 handful each of pomegranate rind, ordinary rosemary and dry roses, a piece of rock alum the size of a nut, Â½ handful of camomile, a little less than half a handful of sweet clover and 1 ounce of coarse sugar. Boil everything together. Then wash the outside of the penis. When the sickness is inside the penis, add a little fresh water to this boiled water and with a syringe or pump put it in the penis.

*Another lavage. Take 4 ounces of barley water, 1 ounce of roses, 1 ounce of mother's milk or goat's milk and 1 dram of zinc oxide. Mix everything together and push it in the penis.
