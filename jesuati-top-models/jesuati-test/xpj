If you would like to augment the simple water, put these things therein, viz., Â½ ounce of orris root, 1 ounce of white sandalwood, 1 nutmeg, and 2 ounces of benzoin gum. Everything should be coarsely cut, plus 20 intact cloves. Put everything in the water and stopper it well and put it in the sun for at least 20 days. Every day when it is warm, mix it very thoroughly upside down so that the sun makes the odor compound by stewing in that way. In this way you will have a very wonderful, fragrant water that can be smelled from a distance.
