Another to cure hemorrhoids. Take 2 ounces each of clean roots of marsh mallow cut finely, camomile, mallow and cypress nuts and 3 ounces each of flax seeds and fenugreek and cook these well in water from the blacksmith until it reduces in half. Then wash yourself 2 or 3 times a day and you will be cured. Take some roots of figwort, which is similar to dead nettle, grind it and make a pancake and eat it for 4 or 5 mornings and you will be cured quickly.
