Prayer against fever to wear around the neck. First say a Pater Noster, in the name of God, Amen +. “When the unbelievers were leading Jesus Christ to be crucified, + + + , Christ began to tremble + and the unbeliever said, + 'What is the matter, Christ, that you tremble? + + + Do you have fever?' + Christ said, 'No, I have no fever + and never will I have.' ” One who will say these words or will carry them on him + + + to the honor of God and the Holy Trinity + will never have fever + and if he has it, he will be freed quickly. 'Christ died + and was resurrected. Amen.'
