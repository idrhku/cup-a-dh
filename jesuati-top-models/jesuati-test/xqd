Also drinking one ounce 2 or 3 times in the space of an hour is very powerful for those who have eaten sorb apples, pears, chestnuts, cornelian cherries, sour grapes, pears or quinces or any other fruit that sticks in the throat, anything that is not able to go down or up, at once it frees it so there is no more such distress. Drinking it in this way frees those who have hiccoughs from flatulence of the stomach, from whatever cause.
