Take green and fresh pine nuts and cut them in half or in 4 parts and distill water from them in the glass still. Then take cypress berries and cut them similarly and put them to soften in a bottle with olive oil that barely covers them and leave them for four days. Make oil from the nuts by distilling them on a low fire and at the end increase the fire and the material will come out more quickly although it will have the same power. Also distill water from the root of the wild squash, that is bryony. Then take a quantity of each of these three waters and mix them together and distill it one more time. This water will be perfect and good to treat and cure legs rapidly. Save it in a glass bottle for your needs. To use it, wet in the water fine cloths the size of the sore place and no larger. Do not put on any other unguent because this alone will cure every old sore on the legs.

For intestinal rupture, a plaster very strong and wonderful to cure it.
