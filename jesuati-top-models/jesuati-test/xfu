Take 1 ounce each of flour of lupins and egg shell pulverized very finely, 2 ounces of honey and 1 Â½ ounces of linseed oil and incorporate them well together on a slow fire and it is made. When you have removed it from the fire, put in 2 scruples of camphor, cut minutely, and stir continually until it is cold and it will be made, the best and gentle remedy. With this rub the hemorrhoids several times and the blood will stop and the pain will go away quickly.
