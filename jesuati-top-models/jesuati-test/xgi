Another poultice for closing sores, very well tested. Take 6 ounces of turpentine, 4 ounces of rose honey, 1 ounce of myrrh and enough barley flour. Melt the turpentine on a slow fire, then mix in the rose honey. Remove it from the fire and put in the myrrh and put in as much of the flour as needed to knead into a soft paste. Then it will be made, your good and perfect poultice that you will be able to use at your pleasure on any sore or open abcess in the way described above, putting twists of yarn on the little disks. It will bring you honor.
