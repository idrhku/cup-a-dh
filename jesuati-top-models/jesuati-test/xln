Take 1 ounce each of mummy, fir tree oil and elm oil, 1 dram each of parchment glue, colofony, cypress nuts, hepatic aloe and rabbit skin, ½ dram each of Armenian red clay, greater comfrey, dragon's blood gum, gum ammoniac, myrrh, galbanum and juniper gum, 2 drams each of mastic, incense, tragacanth, gum arabic and lodestone, 5 drams of naval pitch, 1 ½ drams each of rabbit blood and Solomon's seal, 2 ounces of clean wax and ½ ounce of femoral bone. Melt all the gums in strong vinegar and make all the other things into very fine powder and incorporate everything well on a little fire with great diligence and it will make a plaster in the usual form. Save this for your needs. When you wish to treat, spread it on chamois leather and shave the place and put it on the pubic region on the side where the illness is felt. Wrap it well and tightly with a truss of fustian and when you put it on, extend it around the body. Reassure the sick person to have much patience and not do too much that is fatiguing and not eat too much. He should watch what he eats and not eat things that cause flatulence, nor pork meat and eat food well cooked, not legumes nor sour things.

You should know how to care for yourself in everything so that soon with the aid of God you will be cured. Also you will improve even if, by chance, you have had such an infirmity for many years. If this plaster does not help, try these others written below, viz.
