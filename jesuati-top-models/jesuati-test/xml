Take the berries of buckthorn at the end of the month of September when they are very mature and dark and have had cold, that is a frost, at least one time because they gain more laxative value. Take the amount that you want and put them in a heap, that is, stack them up together in a warm place for 8 to 10 days. Then put them in the press in a sack and press them and extract all the juice. Take 1 lb. of this juice and 1 lb. of cleaned honey and mix them together. Then put everything in a clean pot and when it is very warm strain it through muslin and put it back in the pot and boil it slowly, stirring well so it is incorporated. Let it boil until it takes on body such that when you take a little on the end of a knife and let a drop fall on a card, it stays firm on the card as a hard button. Then it is made. Remove it from the fire and while it is still warm, put in 1 ounce of cinnamon, 2 ounces of ginger and Â½ ounce of nutmeg, all made into very fine powder. Mix everything well together and when it is cold, put it in your bottle and keep it for your needs. When you want to use it, before you go to eat take a spoonful of it rolled into the form of pine nuts. Then eat them slowly on your lunch. In that morning that you take them, you should take care that you do not go outdoors. Stay in the room, if you wish, so that it will work well and give aid to the body. Soon it will lift the pain of gout and purge the body and help greatly in other problems with debilitated nerves. There is a story of this electuary that an angel taught it to a holy father and he called it the 'Angelic electuary.' It has been tested.
