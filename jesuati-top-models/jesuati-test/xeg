Take 1 ½ drams of scammony, 3 drams of turbith, 1 dram each of cinnamon, cloves, herb bennet and ginger, 2 drams each of dittany, myrrh and holy wormseed and 6 ounces of fine sugar. Compound all these things and make a good confection and save it for your needs. When the person feels pain in the body because of worms, at once give him 1 dram if he is an adult and if he is small give him ½ dram and the pain will cease at once and the worms will all go away through the bowels. This is a rare secret.

Tested charm against worms.

Make a little note and attach it to the neck of the child and let it stay until it falls off by itself. When it is attached to the neck, say 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Maria and bind it 3 times to the patient. This charm has been tested repeatedly, that is, write this, viz., 'Job was freed of worms. Just as they were dead and he was freed, may these be dead, may they be gathered, may they go out, may they be turned to water through the incarnation and compassion of our Lord, Jesus Christ. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.' Be confident that this will cure rapidly and they will not return again.
