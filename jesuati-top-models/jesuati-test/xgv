When a marriage may be troubled by discord.

Say to the husband and wife that in the evening when they want to go to bed, they should say devoutly on their knees these two psalms, 'Judge me, O Lord, for I am innocent.' The second, 'The hymn is raised for thee, O God, in Sion.' and all the short creed with 3 Pater Noster and 3 Ave Maria. Then the husband or other person should say this prayer, viz., 'As the 3 magi were to go together to visit Jesus Christ, so we can enjoy holy matrimony together. As Jesus Christ received the milk from the Virgin Mary, so may I be received by my wife in holy matrimony, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. So be it.' At the end they say a Pater Noster and soon, through God's grace, they will be unbound and freed from discord.
