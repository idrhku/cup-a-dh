Another to make a great and lasting memory, very quick and retentive. This wonderful unguent was used by Pope John and Pope Urban. Viz. Take 4 ounces each of roots of bugloss and of lesser valerian and 2 ounces of roots of rue and powder them finely. Then take 1 ounce of cashew nuts and make it into fine powder. Next take 1 ounce of testicles of a 2 year old beaver and 2 ounces of well-powdered ash tree seeds. Blend together the powdered cashew, the beaver testicles and the ash tree seeds. All of the above things can be mixed with the juice and the powders. Then take a little pot of vitreous terra cotta and put it on the fire and put therein some bear fat and melt it. Put in the powders with the juices, little by little, always mixing and putting in some of the fat until it makes a very soft unguent. Rub the temples, the site of the memory, the forehead and the nape of the neck with this. Do this 3 or 4 times a year. Continue this rubbing at various times. When the memory is seriously faulty, rub more or less according to how you see the need.

Another. Take the herb that is called ranchata and make it into juice mixed with a quantity of grains of long pepper and put it in the hot sun for 15 to 20 days. Then remove the pepper grains and put the water again in the sun until it appears that it is well made. When you want to use it, wet and rub both temples, the head, the wrists and the hands very well. Do this 2 times a month, according to how you see the need. When you want to be more active to do work in the clinic, you want to drink a half glass of this water in the evening and at the same time bathe the wrists.

*Another to make a good voice. Take hyssop and cook it in water with honey and dry figs and drink this decoction. It removes cough and clears up the voice, heals the lungs and the chest of the humors that descend from the head. Drinking it repeatedly gives the face a good color.
