Water to drink for quartan fever.

Take a pot that holds 3 glasses and fill it with clean water and say over it 3 times this devotional prayer, with 3 Pater Noster in honor of God and the Holy Trinity, viz., “When our Lord was martyred the air, the sky and the earth shook. The unbeliever said, 'Are you afraid, Christ, or do you have a fever?' 'I am not afraid and I do not have a fever, and who drinks this water through my love and through my charity, the fever will go away and never return.' Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Amen.” At the blessing take a little of this water in your mouth and spit it on the wall. Do this 3 times and what is left over from the 3 glasses, throw on the fire, and you will be cured.
